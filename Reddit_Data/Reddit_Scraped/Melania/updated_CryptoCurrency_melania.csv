He abused his position of power to enrich himself and his cronies blatantly and eroded the rule of law and our faith in our institutions and each other. He continues to do this today.  He stole classified documents that he stored unsecurely and used to brag to foreign agents without proper security clearances because he has a pathological need to be liked.  He tried to end our democracy by inciting a riot at the Capitol with lies, misinformation, and manipulation with the goal of installing himself over what the voters wanted. And now he wants to pardon those people who killed federal police officers and sought to hang our VP at the time for doing his ceremonial duty.  He tried to end our democracy by heading a plot to subvert the state certifications of electors in all swing states of the 2020 election.  He has started and continued an information war painting immigrants as evil criminals and a danger to our ""blood"" (hmm where have we heard that type of rhetoric before?) instead of what they are: the defining source of strength and ingenuity that made America the powerhouse it is today.   He is granting an illegal (but white) immigrant unfettered access to his power and also all government spending...which the richest man in the world intends to abuse to enrich himself and his cronies further with government contracts and anti-competitive business practices.  And so...so...SO much more, but at the end of the day, the worst thing he has done to America is stoke division and give the absolute worst among us free reign to drag us into a hell forged from their ignorance of the most basic principles of science, economics, geopolitics, and human decency, morality, and empathy.  What you said is nothing but one of the handwaving-away logical fallacies (in this case strawman) typically offered by 1) the ignorant who aren't paying attention, 2) brainwashed MAGAt cultists, or 3) people without ethics who seek to normalize this extreme behavior simply because they feel it benefits them.",CryptoCurrency

It has worked tremendously in its pumps and recovery from dumps to make investors think it will always rise in value.  But it still is short term in the form of years, a couple decades.  Albeit one hell of a short term investment success.  A marketing departments wet dream. It will likely be in quite a few marketing and advertising textbooks along with DJT stock for topics on how to influence an energetic and engaged sales profile.  It has been mind blowingly successful, but it still will always have no real world usage or long term value.  There is a high unlikelihood that bitcoin can maintain its value once it stagnates as the final few bitcoins are mined.  Especially if the US government is conned into taking 25% of it out of circulation and investors hands.  Once the novelty hits the light of day with activity levels dropping.  Interest will drop and so will it‚Äôs value, because you can‚Äôt do anything with it unless you continue to trick other people into believing of value.  And I would argue against your random meme coin thought, because Donald Trump has already proven that he can create a DJT meme stock and make billions of dollars off of it.  All without investing a single cent.  Sure, the original founders are not getting as much as they wanted, but those guys still are making out with a tremendous sum with a very low amount of effort.  They have the overwhelming number of shares.  And the entirety of the shares value comes from enthusiastic followers.  I am also curious, if anyone knows, are there any thoughts out there about once bitcoin hits its hard ceiling, are any other companies or coins poised to take over the narrative that bitcoin was too limited and the *New Coin* is the properly scarce coin for the future that can handle distribution and usage at any kind of useful scale‚Ä¶ and in a timely fashion.",CryptoCurrency

About 5 hrs ago there was a huge whale that sold $30M worth of $TRUMP around the exact same time Melania tweeted her new memecoin address. Many whales followed. Retail gamblers (because let's be real, it's gambling) soon tried to follow. The overwhelming number of transactions almost brought down the Solana network and exchanges were bogged down by people trying to sell everything for sol and $MELANIA. Solana fees that are typically around $.08 on a busy day rose to almost $10 per tx. I usually only keep .01 Sol onhand for gas fees, but that wasn't enough. It took 3 hours for Coinbase to transfer funds to my Phantom wallet and by that point it was too late to buy in cheap.

Thank you for the interesting read!   For anyone curious but lazy, here‚Äôs a bit from one of his best known essays, The Society of the Spectacle written in 1967:  In his analysis of the spectacular society, Debord notes that the quality of life is impoverished, with such a lack of authenticity that human perceptions are affected; and an attendant degradation of knowledge, which in turn hinders critical thought. Debord analyzes the use of knowledge to assuage reality: the spectacle obfuscates the past, imploding it with the future into an undifferentiated mass, a type of never-ending present. In this way, the spectacle prevents individuals from realizing that the society of spectacle is only a moment in history, one that can be overturned through revolution.",CryptoCurrency

I think they will. Who would ever turn down a meme coin that makes them instantly rich? Hey, politician, want money? Let me know when they say no. It‚Äôs like the instant wealth from being president just skipped all steps and gave you money for just passing GO. Game theory dictates that the next act of exceptionalism will be the president that *turns it down* to prove they are serious, because this shit is straight up a Pandora‚Äôs box.  2. Hodl inflation resistant assets and inflate away competitors seems pretty proven strategy historically. We will know more in coming days and weeks. UBI seems unlikely though because early efforts have been lackluster. Idk how it‚Äôs going to work. Spot on Q.  3. What even is value based investing at this point? Elon‚Äôs all-in bet on trump was 2024‚Äôs top trade, though nobody is talking about it. WTF is FV in 2025? Honestly, it‚Äôs so detached from traditional metrics idk anymore. Is right and left just air cover for the movement of big money? Bet you ass. Look at Jamie‚Äôs Bitcoin shilling while they load up. Playbook is obvious. Seems more and more like distractions for plebs. Soon run by all bot networks like online dating. Enjoy the outrage.  4. Yea. Budget crisis hits the day after inauguration, so thats fun. And I think chicken death flu could be coming. And California is going to have fire fallout as soon as they let the properties trade again ‚Äî they literally stopped trading for 3 months lol. It‚Äôs insane how much is lined up to bomb this year already. I am not a pessimist but this shit is hilarious.  What you want to do is a small allocation to crypto and just ignore it. Put it in BTC or ETH and just leave it there. That‚Äôs how most people actually made money because nobody can actually trade. The most successful trader I know made all his money because he won a lawsuit that locked up his Bitcoin for 8 years, and when he finally won he went from living in his parents house to a big private boat in one check. Shut up Steve from your parents basement, we know you can trade. It‚Äôs just that everyone else that Yolos like a slot machine and has the maturity of a 14 year old with a newfound inheritance that can‚Äôt.  But with regards to what I was talking about with the whole reality of value itself being hollowed out, the same playbook is being used outside of markets too. This is less thought through, but I‚Äôll try.  The whole thing that‚Äôs happening with Trump and these rich dudes‚Ä¶ Silicon Valley‚Äôs rebranding as ‚Äúbased‚Äù or ‚Äúlibertarian‚Äù is just tokenization by another name.¬†  This shit with Elon and Mark ‚Äî they are not delivering real change or independence‚Äîthey‚Äôre selling the *appearance* of it. I know, that part is obvious.  The same forces that have always been tied to the system are now dressing up as its critics, offering a product that looks like rebellion but is really just more of the same. It‚Äôs not about dismantling anything; it‚Äôs about co-opting dissent and turning it into a commodity. That‚Äôs why Reddit is the way it is. It was SO blatant in this election it was nuts.  But this is what happens *when trust becomes the currency*. With public institutions losing credibility, the private sector steps in to offer an alternative‚Äîbut it‚Äôs all part of the same game. Public to private, left to right, it‚Äôs just a shell game designed to keep people distracted.¬†  The deeper game is clear: control isn‚Äôt exercised by force but by manipulating perception, whether through tokenized assets or tokenized ideologies. It‚Äôs all projection, and the more we buy into it, the further disconnected we become from anything real.  So, worth buying? If you can figure out how, it‚Äôs a thesis that could inform some good bets yea.",CryptoCurrency

It will be the greatest wealth transfer from Americans to foreign entities, if it succeeds.  The CEXs first to list these coins are often also the CEXs Americans have no access to.",CryptoCurrency

It rhymes. But rarely do you find a reprint.  The collapse of the Roman Republic was driven by a toxic concentration of wealth, institutional breakdown, and the manipulation of public anger by elites who turned democracy into theater. There are good books on it.  The Gilded Age in the U.S. offered its own version: monopolists controlled vast swaths of the economy while buying politicians wholesale, all while feeding the illusion that upward mobility was still within reach.¬†  But this isn‚Äôt just a repeat of those eras. That narrative is just too simplistic.¬†  It‚Äôs an evolution.¬†  The tools have changed, and now the machinery of control is subtler and as a result a hell of a lot more insidious.¬†  Wealth is no longer just hoarded but weaponized through global networks and opaque financial systems that are all but untouchable ‚Äî that‚Äôs why the WEF is trying to get to global alternative minimum taxes, and why all of the crypto funds are being used by politicians so overtly. I mean why the fuck is Dana White joining the Meta/Facebook board?  You know why.  https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/dana-white-john-elkann-charlie-songhurst-meta-board-of-directors/  Social media doesn‚Äôt just amplify populist narratives; it fragments reality itself, creating echo chambers where people can be manipulated into believing they‚Äôre the ones making informed choices, when in fact they‚Äôre being herded toward predetermined outcomes.  It‚Äôs all on display on Reddit every day. But people buy the narrative. Everything is framed to each side‚Äôs fears.¬†  What makes this moment unique is how power is reinforced not only through economic domination but through the commodification of dissent itself. The value of dissent is immense. And monetizable through digital ID. ;)  People know the system has failed them, but their anger is redirected, tokenized, and sold back to them in the form of political slogans, consumer choices, and performative rebellion. This isn‚Äôt just oligarchy; it‚Äôs oligarchy draped in the veneer of participation, where the act of resistance itself has become part of the system‚Äôs profit model.  The tragedy is that this has the same inevitability as every collapse before it.¬†  When institutions fail and public trust erodes, power fills the void. But the modern twist is how easily dissent has been neutralized, not by silencing it but by turning it into another product, another trend, another spectacle. We aren‚Äôt just watching history repeat‚Äîwe‚Äôre watching it adapt, refine itself, and grow more resilient to the very forces that once tore similar systems apart.  I really, really suggest looking deeper than team left or team right. Stop hate speech! Protect children! Stop immigration! It‚Äôs issue x for target y. All of it is about placating whatever demographic they want to target. Full stop.  So, while you talk about the Oligarchy understand it‚Äôs so much more complex and we should be looking much more deeply not at what the story that is told is, but what the actions are of the people telling it.  It will be obvious in hindsight.",CryptoCurrency

Henceforth be thy lesson :   So let's talk about nodes and consensus as defined in the whitepaper and implemented in nodes.   Let's start with [the bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) :  > Satoshi from the Bitcoin white-paper chapter 12 'Conclusion' : The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. **Nodes** work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. **Nodes** can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this **consensus mechanism**.  First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :  > https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_%28computer_science%29  > A fundamental problem in distributed computing and multi-agent systems is to achieve overall system reliability in the presence of a number of faulty processes. This often requires processes to agree on some data value that is needed during computation. Examples of applications of consensus include whether to commit a transaction to a database *(or, for example, committing blocks to a blockchain)*, agreeing on the identity of a leader, state machine replication, and atomic broadcasts. The real world applications include clock synchronization, PageRank, opinion formation, smart power grids, state estimation, control of UAVs, load balancing and others.  What does this mean if you are but an intrepid traveler amongst the erstwhile numpty-folk?  Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with [an agreed set of consensus rules](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_rules), which they and they alone enforce, that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. Then the node, which is an agent in a multi-agent system, extends the block-chain by attaching the new block to it, on their own copy of the blockchain housed within that node.  They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.  Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them, and it is the only thing they do. Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node extends the blockchain.  Miners don't.  The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.  It is the validation of the nodes, and their CPU's, that define and police consensus in bitcoin.  There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.  Miners work.  Nodes validate.  So nodes are the proof in proof-of-work.   Nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions (using their CPU), replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks (using their CPU), extend the blockchain (using their CPU), replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.  If you can't convince these node owners that are using their nodes on a day-to-day basis, to uninstall their node software and install your new node client, especially when that node client decreases their node security and decreases the network security, any change you have is going to go exactly nowhere.  So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.  If you can't convince all of those node owners running their node clients to uninstall one client and re-install another, any change you have to consensus is DOA.  See for yourself.  [Download it.](https://bitcoin.org/en/download)  It's currently at 27.0.  https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node  > A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.  Thus endeth thy lesson.",CryptoCurrency

American citizens choose to elect a candidate who only thinks about one thing: getting as rich as possible by taking advantage of his position. This candidate then chose an administration full of people who share his vision of power and the benefits that can be gained from it.  Be careful, I'm not saying that it was better with Biden, or that it would have been better with Kamala Harris. In any case, it would have been disappointing. But in the end, we shouldn't have expected anything else with Donald Trump. Some believed that he had suddenly become a Bitcoiner.

The major refutation I can share is that everything on this planet requires human intervention. The fabric of the internet itself requires constant maintenance by millions of people every single day, why should anything the blockchain or smart contracts be any different?   Let's look at a use-case example of moving legal title ownership to blockchain in place of requiring paperwork to be filed with a city administrator.  Blockchain is one way to optimize that process, another is simply improved centralized digitization of those assets.  Blockchain offers the ""advantage"" of not needing to rely on a central managing organization, but the value proposition disintegrates with recognition that most things need to be administrated or overseen.  Crypto has already, in its short life, shown how horribly wrong things go when things are flawed and fully autonomous. Bad code or no control truly means no recourse. Even perfect code can be exploited. All it takes to transfer a land title in a smart-contract organized society is a gun held to someone's head. Not nearly so simple in our present system.

This satellite runs on the Hedera network. https://wisesat.wisekey.com/?tags=WISeSat  From the website:  ***Q4: How does Hedera‚Äôs blockchain infrastructure integrate with WISeKey‚Äôs solutions?***  *Hedera‚Äôs decentralized ledger technology is integrated into WISeKey‚Äôs solutions to enhance security, scalability, and sustainability. This integration supports secure machine-to-machine (M2M) transactions and enables autonomous interactions between IoT devices.*  So I can infer their tech network uses Hedera for some form of authentication or something those lines, that's wildly different than the satellite ""running on Hedera""  > Do you own a farm and want to receive carbon credits or allow people to invest in farms with organic methods? Go to this market place that is also ran on Hedera https://app.dovu.market  To the point in my previous point, someone must audit whether or not those carbon credits are valid.  You can make a web app that is based on either a centralized or decentralized database, but blockchain or ledgers doesn't eliminate the real-world challenge of the carbon validation efforts.  The only differentiator is if you believe, for whatever reason, that this system benefits from a decentralized ledger over a regular mutable database.  Countries that regulate carbon emissions have onerous tracking and audit requirements, which are a function of how the carbon marketplace is managed more than where the data is stored.  You could pull up more examples and I could pull out more refutations.",CryptoCurrency

Maybe part b of that is that they knew Trump supporters would buy in and provide some liquidity for the initial insiders to also exit with a profit. In that case then you could effectively put in your million dollars to help Trump, watch the coin price rise, then after Trump takes his profit you can exit and take a profit as well.

Just Google the amount of times PoW of and PoS have been attacked. PoW dozens of times while PoS has never been broken.  Both Bitcoin (in 2010 and 2013) and Ethereum (in 2014 and 2016) while still under PoW have been 51% reorged 2 times. And then there are all the PoW altcoins that have been attacked numerous times.

It's been ground to dust by the constant deregulation.  Even if 99.9999999999999999% of human beings were moral and followed a set of rules not enforced, but just because, as soon as a single person decides to do things in an immoral way, not only does it entice others to do so as well, but it nearly forces them to in every situation, lest they become unable to compete against the under-cutter. Actual laws and regulation are there for a reason, and they existed to try and stop the last 40 years of business takeover and decentralized, ungovernable power. Trump just decided to push it to the extreme; he is both the result of deregulation and will be the cause of society's downfall, and that is not an exaggeration: he has and will continue to normalize the every-man-for-themselves strategy. That has led to the downfall of every great society and civilization in the past, full stop. A society is plural, and necessitates cooperation and organization between people, which necessitates support and safety.  China won. Through Russia they got their man, they don't even need to pull any strings. You want a toy destroyed? Just give it to a dog, they know what to do. The USA will lose their world reserve currency status and that 30T in debt that conservatives love to complain about will actually affect us for the first time ever. Imagine ever thinking a trade deficit matters when you can never have a balance of payment crisis because most of the trade is denominated in the currency you can freely print and use to pay external actors thereby mitigating its domestic inflationary effects and almost for free wipe away any debt (the US could literally import things *for free*, I don't think people understand that's how we got so powerful), plus the increase of supply has a disproportionally small effect on reducing its value because other countries store it due to its reserve currency status.

So those of you being offended about scams and taking money. Number one, people have to buy this, no one is making you do that. If I launch some random coin or you guys going to come buy it? Then there's the argument that oh this is the president and they launched this a day before the inauguration for obvious reasons, like he wasn't the president yet, legal loophole, maybe? Then again he does have his own people at Justice so probably.   I'm trying to think of the easiest way to put this because I totally get what's going on and it seems like a lot of you don't. Trump is very transactional right. He thinks in a bit of a criminal mentality right? This is launched, we know his people hold large bags of Ethereum and who knows what else, if they want to extract value from the market it has to come up. All of his people know as well as we do, if he releases Ross, he even says that they're considering a Bitcoin reserve, prices  go up, it's more liquidity and more interest in the market. Driving down everything and scaring people is not in their interest. Maybe it's just that I've been involved in this for over 10 years so scams and pumps and fake info and all that is just normal to me but there's nothing bearish going on here. You actively have the president of the United States in a crypto supportive position. Last administration, we had Gary, we had legal challenges we had obstacles we had people getting arrested left and right. Now, it's wild west, they're going to let all the shenanigans run. Lots of people like to gamble right. They like to just throw money at things, get into projects, so on and so forth, do you think that's more likely or less likely? Because the path forward seems very straight, at least for the next few months. How long it goes, now that's the tricky part but that's what makes the game fun  Just remember this, market tops do not take place on extreme fear, what's the sentiment right now?

To understand the scam you need to understand crypto a bit better.  Generally tokens and coins are created with some form of use case. Eth as a network, some are meant to be as a peg to USD (usdc, usdt) some have links to banking (xrp), some are rivals to Eth (avax, bnb, sol).  Anyway - a subset of these usecases are meme coins, typically these are your SHIB, DOGE, pepe. Theres no point to holding or buying them, but you'll find that price increases as more people buy and hold for whatever reason they have. (They like the coin, there are other incentives to holding).  Generally memes have a bad rap as they have no use case and performance wise, almost always devalues in a long enough timeframe as again, the hype dies with the coin and people start to sell. We see this happen a lot with the exception of a few (shib/doge/wif) but a lot of memecoins have come and gone.  What makes this a scam is:  1.) Theres no use case for the token, meaning its created and sold with the sole purpose of creating hype and dumping onto buyers. This is horrific especially from a public figure let alone from the POTUS  2.) A large majority of the tokens are owned by the deployer - most tokens are 'fair launched' or similar, meaning even the deployer cant hold most of the supply. Whoever owns the majority of the supply can dump on its buyers as we have seen happen in the last 24 hours.  3.) He clearly is not interested in anything long term for this project. Most tokens have some form of roadmap, even some of the meme coins. Clearly he is doing this to pump and dump.  4.) Releasing two tokens in 48 hours (trump/melania tokens) is audacious. He is clearly scamming and clearly thinks he's gonna get away with it (he probably will)  5.)

We've been thru much worse climate/natural disaster wise in the last few hundred thousand years. Will modern civilization survive, thrive, and continue to evolve? 200 years, more than likely, imo..Billions of humans could die and we'd still be populated to a point never seen in post-diluvian history. 7.5 billion could be lost and we'd still have a bigger population than 1000 years ago.   All opinions here but we'd have to see an evolution of another human species to see the extinction of homosapiens. As of right now, it seems, all of our cousins are extinct. It would take more than 500 years for a branch off to happen and then overtake homosapiens as the dominant human species. One of the reasons humanity has been able to evolve and thrive is that we've been relatively lucky from a natural disaster/climate perspective over the last 11,000 years. Nothing cataclysmic has happened since the flood...There are massive cave dwelling systems all throughout the world and if need be humans can go back underground and survive catastrophe. Sure, many will perish and there will be a reboot of civilization and culture. It won't be the first time this has had to happen. There's evidence that points to a similar event roughly 11,000ish years ago, as the last Ice Age was ending. Pretty much every culture since the Sumerians has a flood ""myth"" or story. Multiple species of humans lived and evolved thru the last Ice Age, as well. The Earth is massive and underground/mountain caves are always an option. There will certainly be another cataclysm but humans have proven to be pretty damn resilient and able to reboot.",CryptoCurrency

America has elected someone with absolutely no respect for the constitution. They have elected someone who tried to overthrow the largest democratic election in the world. They have elected someone who knows no decency, humility, dignity, respect or grace. They've elected a greedy, self-serving, manipulative snake who successfully psy-op'd a majority of smooth-brained idiots into keeping him out of prison, where he belongs for a litany of crimes.     If this only affected Americans, I would be laughing my arse off. As it happens, Trump is a spiteful, vindictive man-child who will happy take revenge on anyone and everyone who rightfully criticised his first catastrophic run as President. That includes the leaders of my country, as well as our neighbours. He looks up to and is beholden to Dictators and adversaries of the West. He will sell out our allies to curry favour with those who he sees as ""strongmen"" and will get utterly played by them, increasing the global instability. Ukraine, I fear, will be handed to Russia on a platter who will only be hungry for more.     In short, why am I angry? Because hundreds of years ago our collective ancestors came together and did some pretty awful things to Native Americans, but they created a Republic with some simple and relatively unique qualities. All men are equal. Anyone can make something of themselves if they try. Justice for all.    And Trump's re-election is the greatest spit in the face of the American fore-fathers imaginable. And while millions of Americans queued up in the polling stations to spit in the faces of Thomas Jefferson et al, Trump now gets ready to spit in yours.    The most powerful person on the planet is also an adjudicated rapist, an adjudicated fraud, a vindictive whiny crybaby and a total charlatan.    So why aren't you angry?

They all have huge sums of cash on hand to throw at every project under the sun that might be viable, in not doing so they risk being left behind. Same reason they went around hiring every software engineer they could get their hands on during the pandemic only to fire most of them a couple years later. Its the same reason AI, LLMs, machine learning and big data have each been hyped to high heaven only to disappear into irrelevancy one by one.

It‚Äôs an MLM in crypto form.   Enough people buy in, the value goes up, the creators sell their allotted portion which they got for basically free because they created the asset out of thin air, the price then crashes and fools are left holding the valueless piece of data.   The 80% holding for owners is how you know it‚Äôs a scam. If it was a true and fair coin launch they wouldn‚Äôt hold near that much for themselves, because that‚Äôs obviously wrong to do. Also the fact that it‚Äôs a MEME is a huge indicator it‚Äôs a scam, because they‚Äôre admitting it‚Äôs just a joke and serves no purpose other than to make us rich. Some tokens have utility and can do things, this one cannot. It‚Äôs a digital collectible.    There‚Äôs no question it‚Äôs a snake oil salesman gimmick, but that in and of itself is not the biggest issue, people sell crap all the time to suckers, it‚Äôs bad, but it happens.   The issue is the PRESIDENT of the USA is the snake oil salesman here, literally profiteering off his position AT THE EXPENSE OF AMERICANS. That‚Äôs the joke and we‚Äôre all the ones being laughed at. It cheapens the office of the presidency and lessens trumps respectability (not that he had much to start with).   And the worst part of all, is that it might not even just be a scam for money, it might actually be more insidious. It could be an untraceable way for foreign entities to launder money to trump in return for favors. ‚ÄúJust buy $100m of my meme coin, and yeah I‚Äôll consider whatever laws you want passed.‚Äù  The USA is for sale with trump in office and we should all be worried",CryptoCurrency

Having a gold reserve helps bolster the US dollar, even though it‚Äôs not directly tied to it anymore.  Suggesting a Nvidia reserve seems somewhat disingenuous. It‚Äôs a totally different type of asset to something like bitcoin or gold.   If you think the U.S. should not have a gold reserve, then we will just have to agree to disagree about a bitcoin reserve.   If you do agree with the gold reserve, then I think you should consider a bitcoin reserve the same way. Except it has a fixed supply. Gold is theoretically a fixed supply too. But, one of, if not the largest gold deposit ever was just found last year. This obviously isn‚Äôt ideal if you‚Äôre heavily invested in gold.

Actually got lucky with safemoon and made like 120k off 10k and then held it to 500 bucks, which I can‚Äôt even trade anymore. Let the hopium get to me and didn‚Äôt take any profits.   This cycle my plan was to pick like 10-20 mid to high cap coins I thought were promising and as I made some money I would redistribute profits into other promising projects that hadn‚Äôt pumped yet, with some going to smaller cap coins.   I‚Äôve had a similar strategy before, but I would just sell everything to chase a project that was sending and of course end up just losing my money.   This time around, I barely touch my investments except when there‚Äôs a massive gain and then I just take some off the top to reinvest elsewhere.   I‚Äôm at about 150k right now from this slow and emotion removed approach. Everything I‚Äôm in I hope can 3x - I‚Äôm out if I hit 500ish-k this cycle. Important to set goals.   All that said, with 2k I would probably just pick a single token with lots of promise. Also one that matches a current narrative. Something with community backing and ideally located in the US. Best if it‚Äôs relatively new (only 1-2 cycles old) and maybe hasn‚Äôt quite popped yet. You can look at trumps wallet - it‚Äôs public. You should assume what he owns is based on deep insider knowledge and if you can‚Äôt trust the man you should trust that he‚Äôll be nothing but self serving.   Based on the above, one of my big bets this cycle is Ondo. Maybe you don‚Äôt make 100x, but good chance you might make 10x. Sell that and wait till cycle bottom to buy another project that‚Äôs bottomed out but is maybe top 20. When things start climbing again you can use those profits to redistribute amongst other coins. Also best that you start to DCA where you can.   Best of luck.",CryptoCurrency

The advice I thought about giving them was this: every time you want to gamble on a risky investment you have to buy an equal amount into Bitcoin which you will plan to hold for at least 4 years. Example, you want to throw $1000 into a basket of risky shitcoins. So in order to do that you need to first buy $1000 in Bitcoin and if you don‚Äôt have $2000, then you would have to split the $1000 and do $500 in Bitcoin and $500 in shitcoins.

One of the easiest aspects of bitcoin to overlook is its absolute scarcity because humans have never seen a monetary asset with a finite supply before. When exchanges get low on btc, the market will enter a supply shock where increasing demand is met with a supply that cannot increase. Anyone who understands the basics of supply/demand dynamics will understand that in the presence of stable or increasing demand, something with limited or in this case, a finite supply must go dramatically higher in value to match the demand.   Where people get tripped up is since Bitcoin‚Äôs beginning, it has been increasing linearly, however a supply shock will increase it exponentially.   On the other hand, while bitcoin is going up in value due to supply/demand and adoption, the dollars value is going down.   I think you will find the numbers bitcoin will reach surprise many people. And because they didn‚Äôt understand the exponential nature of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential, they will be under allocated due to being more interested in gambling with altcoins.

An egomaniac just named a coin after himself and that person happens to be at the head of the most powerful nation in the world.  He‚Äôs way better off financially if the coin is successful long-term than if he cashes out.  If he started selling off the price would plummet and he‚Äôd have diminishing returns each coin he sells.  Or it could become a thing. Southern businesses start taking trump coin and it spreads.  His wealth multiplies and the coins become an asset he can borrow against 1000x more than if he cashed out and killed the coin. It‚Äôs worth throwing a few bucks on even if you hate the guy.,CryptoCurrency

There are countless bot accounts that are single use, designed to artificially inflate a memecoin's number of active users. They receive a small amount of Sol, trade a memecoin once, then send the balance elsewhere. Here's just a tiny selection of the services on Solana that are used to trick you into thinking there is more adoption than there really is.   - chartup.io - bots to pump fake volume and addresses;  - volumex.bot - bots to pump fake volume and addresses;  - tsunami.bot - bots to pump fake volume and addresses;  - cryptotrendbooster.com - bots to pump fake volume and addresses;  - dexvolume.bot -  bots to pump fake volume and addresses;  - flashwash.pro -  bots to pump fake volume and addresses;   etc etc - you get the idea.   This would show up in the data as addresses with extremely low lifetime volumes, and nothing left in them after the one block they are active for.   - **Over 50% of all active addresses interacting with DEX's on Solana have a lifetime volume of less than $10** [See: 'Solana: DEX Active Addresses by Wallet Segment' from https://solana.blockworksresearch.com/?dashboard=sol-dex].    - **About 70% of all wallets that have been active on Solana over the last month have a balance of 0 SOL** [See: 'Daily Active Users, with SOL Wallet Balance' from https://www.hellomoon.io/solana].   I guess it's also worth noting that Solana has a long history of misleading metrics, from their initial lies about the circulating supply, the scandal with fake developer numbers and fake DeFi TVL, misleading TPS stats, bots manipulating stablecoin volume etc etc.   Does any of that matter? Sadly it seems like their strategy is to mislead naive newbies with their dodgy stats, and then once people are invested they can rely on the fact that people don't want to 'FUD their own bags' and so will ignore and deny any reality that makes their investment seem less sensible.",CryptoCurrency

I had some solana when it was around 6 usd and did not expect much of it but somehow it reached over 200 usd. It‚Äôs a solid project in my opinion but it was still a huge rise in price. I credit this rise mostly because it‚Äôs contending with ethereum. How do you think ethereums and solanas price relation will respond after solana gets its ETF? It‚Äôs not guaranteed to happen but i think it‚Äôs likely to happen in this cycle.,CryptoCurrency

They don't realize that many of the trading bots that are used for Solana have to create new wallets to better carry out the trades and once your done, you're not going to keep your SOL or any assets there, so you move them out. That alone accounts for a lot of ""previously active wallets with a current 0 SOL balance"". Then you have to keep in mind that those wallets do about .01% of the volume on Solana, so even when you remove those active addresses, Solana is still crushing with respect to volume. Of course Solana is also crushing it when it come to REV, which is how much the network makes from use, which can't be inflated unless you actually use it substantially. The vast majority of the fees paid are priority fees as well, so even if that was happening, it wouldn't account for any meaningful amount of Solana's REV.   >I guess it's also worth noting that Solana has a long history of misleading metrics, from their initial lies about the circulating supply, the scandal with fake developer numbers and fake DeFi TVL, misleading TPS stats, bots manipulating stablecoin volume etc etc.  [There was on incident with the supply, hardly a lie, and it was settled long ago.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1eg8x6n/blackrock_solana_etf_not_happening_anytime_soon/lfts84x/) Only the most copish of maxis still use this FUD 5 years later.  Anyone who understands crypto at all does not hold ""fake developer numbers"" and ""fake TVL"" against the blockchain, but solely against the developer who faked the numbers. Blockchains cannot dictate how people use them and the Solana Foundation had no part in this. Any developer can do this on any chain. Doing that would be like demonizing paper because someone wrote a bad word on it.  ""Misleading TPS stats"" is ??? IDK, because everywhere that even gives a number for TPS either uses only non-vote TPS or specifically steps out each category. Either way there is only one blockchain doing 1000+ TPS, even when only counting non-vote transactions.  ""Bots manipulating stats on stablecoins"" is funny, because bots are fine, these are networks built for autonomous use, so bots would naturally be part of that. [For example, this bot accounts for roughly a quarter of the DeFi activity on Base and there is nothing wrong with that.](https://x.com/smyyguy/status/1870953803606049064) If there is manipulation, it's easily filtered from the analytics dashboards and is easily spotted. [You'll notice the info button on each chart on the Blockworks Research chart gives context and most of them make a mention to how they are filtering out spam.](https://imgur.com/a/dZYYRbj)  There are more than plenty of indicators that show there is massive genuine use on Solana and even if you generously want to say that half the wallets are fake, that would change very little if anything. Even if they stopped faking it, the other activity would be generating the same good numbers on metrics like REV and DEX volume, as faking active addresses doesn't contribute to either of those in a meaningful way.  [You can see they really like going back to the well to use this specific FUD and love playing it up to be far worse than it is.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i21okr/solana_adoption_is_on_fire_over_10_million_unique/m7aza24/) You'll notice that you never hear this brought up by anyone respected in the industry, it's always clickbaity youtubers or people with vested interests in other projects. The people who I consider to be the most objective and knowledgeable give Solana complete credit for the level of activity it has. I know I'm not a data scientist or professional researcher like the people at Blockworks Research or Messari or Delphi Digital, so I defer to their opinion, and they do not agree with this take at all. Like the literal people who compiled this data and dashboards being referenced in this thread aren't agreeing with that opinion, despite having the most informed and knowledgeable outlook. [You can listen to them talk at length about this stuff comprehensively and they never entertain this theory because they understand the relationship, or lack thereof, between the two metrics exemplified in the previous post with the many other metrics that look just as good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taBJkZkHzCM) I'd be surprised if you listened to this and came out agreeing with them in any capacity.",CryptoCurrency

At this point it's not an interest rate problem.  We had very low rates under Greenspan and Bernanke and didn't have this problem.  We had QE under TARP and didn't have this problem.  When Coca-Cola is posting record profits and saying that they're [increasing prices because customers are simply willing to pay](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/business/coca-cola-q3-earnings.html) more, that's not because interest rates are too low.  It's not because of higher input costs.  And it's not because the ""labor market is too hot"", which is really the only thing the Fed is able to affect by trying to slow the economy.  And if you want to say that low interest rates and QE caused this problem to begin with, then you're just saying that the Fed is the one that is ultimately responsible for causing the problem.

A highly volatile asset on the top right of the risk curve that could give you 2.4% more return.    Do you think that TradFi and even institutional investors are going to go with some asset like Ethereum which most have never heard of to get a paltry 2.4% yield especially if BTC returns the past few years have been significantly better than +2.4% with less risk?  I know /r/cryptocurrency will take this but TradFi/Institutions are not THAT dumb.    The entire point of BTC is to use as a diversifier with an asset that has the great deal less correlation to the traditional asset classes that is high on the risk curve and can provide big returns.  The rest of the digital assets just follow BTC and are riskier and generally provide lower returns.  Why would they even be needed if you are holding BTC? That is enough risk and diversification.,CryptoCurrency

As a kid, maybe 5-7 years old, I used to have this friend. He was the most annoying shit I had ever met. Always making fun of me being a girl.  We were playing, and suddenly he threw his pants down, and made a helicopter with his kid dick. He was saying something along the lines of ""hahaha lalala, I have this pee-pee, and you don't"". I was frustrated, threw my own pants down, showed him my clit, and answered ""WELL ACTUALLY I DO HAVE ONE, it is just smaller than yours"".  I am sure it sounds like ""that never happened"" kind of thing, but later on I have been quite proud of the past me.

SOL is now the bulk of my portfolio(despite starting at like 10%) and since I'm up so much more on my SOL and it accounts for so much of my portfolio, it just doesn't make sense to take profit on ETH unless I expect it to dump.  tldr: don't need to sell, long time horizon on the investment, prioritizing taking profits on other coins that lock in bigger profits, while also rebalancing my portfolio more evenly.",CryptoCurrency

Retail is not investing in the market now and there is a dam good reason why liquidity is drying up... Thanks to Jerome Powell.  By pausing interest rates and the fear of continuing to pause rates, will cause more liquidity issues.  We run on a debt based system.  Money/currency enters the system when it is borrowed.  It leaves the system when the loan is paid back.  Just think how many car loan / home loan payments are made very month.  That is liquidity drying up.  If there were new car loans or home loans then liquidity would stabilize.  But that is not happening.  In the past 5% interest rates was no big deal.  But not when homes have doubled/tripled in valued since last time we had 5% interest rates.  A huge part of the population is just barely making it with such a high cost of living.  Trump's tariff plans might bring production back but it is a slow process.  This is why he wants Powell to lower interest rates.  The Fed always gets is wrong.  And when they try to fix it it is always way to late.   All other Central Banks are lowering interest rates and we need to do the same.  There is a 9 month lag time of how interest rates affect the economy.  But once the fed does a real pivot, everything will change.   All other previous bull markets never had issues with liquidity.

Chow's resignation has sparked discussions on the ethics of high-profile token launches. Meteora and Jupiter exchange, both co-founded by Chow, deny involvement in insider trading, and an independent investigation is planned.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Here it is  Good News / Bad News  GOOD: New exclusive Patreon content and director's commentary!   BAD: We had to scrap our upcoming episode of Coffeezilla about $TRUMP coin.  Here's what happened:¬†  1. We identified a trader on $TRUMP coin who made $100 million sniping (buying early).   2. The wallet clearly had early intel based on their transaction history, we were convinced this was insider information.   3. At the last second before publication, we finally found the person behind it and interviewed them.   4. They denied insider intel and had an equally compelling explanation that they discovered the coin using public information.  While I'm not positive I believe them (plenty of reasons to lie about insider intel), the $TRUMP coin video was built around a premise that I now didn't have full confidence in, so I scrapped the episode even though 80% of the work had been done... leaving the team with a fun episode and nowhere to release it.   I thought I'd leave it here, to memorialize the work, add some director's commentary, explain what we've been up to, and say I think this is just part of the process with journalism.   Sometimes you start a story believing one thing, and end up believing another. If you're lucky, you'll figure all that out before you hit publish!
