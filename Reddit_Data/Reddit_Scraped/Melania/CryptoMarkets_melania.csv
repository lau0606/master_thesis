The market has become 'illiquid'.  In any case, since you don't understand the basics, I know it is really tempting to make a quick buck, but by your own admission, you don't know the simplest thing so shouldn't 'invest' in something you don't understand.  My advice: get reading all the books, google every expression you come across in this space, watch a lot of (educational! not hyping!) videos on Youtube BEFORE you decide to put your money in stuff like this.  MELANIA and other coins come and go; the market will be open 24hrs, and it will be here waiting for you when you're knowledgeable and ready to make money, instead of losing it."

It far outstrips SBF, Hawk Tuah, any exchange closures, all of that. People are seeing that the President of the United States - using no government procedure, no money of his own, no risk of his own, offering no product, with no utility, was able to just imagine into existence billions of dollars of valuation literally overnight. With all the effort of Michael Scott yelling ""I declare bankruptcy!""  A lot of people bought into crypto having either dumb flights of fancy about whatever coin they got becoming 'the way of the future', or they bought into it because they had friends or family members telling them to and they didn't understand it but assumed there must have been something to it that they weren't grasping. And now you have every single major news outlet in the US about to explain what exactly this $TRUMP and $MELANIA garbage is, what can you use it for, what can you buy with it, what do you get for having it, and the audiences you need for 'mainstream adoption' are going to hear a unanimous answer - fucking nothing. You can't buy anything with it. It doesn't give you some kind of special status.  And this scam will become linguistically and societally associated with all other coins, scam or otherwise. Why wouldn't Trump start hawking ""TRUMP COIN AND MELANIA COIN!"" at every speech? Is he really ever going to say ""no, no, don't worry about Trump Coin and Melania Coin, start buying Bitcoin again instead""?    This will become the common understanding of what cryptocurrency is, across the board."

Actually buying things that have zero utility with a promise of never having any value or announcing you did so publicly.  When anyone outside of the crypto space hypes up something that is fundamentally crap, everyone here in cc should join ranks, call them out, and give them a universal salute.  Until that day comes, this place is not for any serious conversation."

SOL is another great bet but it's shooting rn so not the best time to get in.

Short-term trading isn‚Äôt for amateurs like you or me‚Äîit‚Äôs for the top 1% who typically work at massive hedge funds with plenty of company-owned assets.

Feel free to call me an asshole and continue doing what you‚Äôre doing‚Äîit won‚Äôt affect me, but you‚Äôll keep losing money. Also, remember: the more volatile crypto is, the less functional it becomes in the long run. Ultimately, the most stable coins will be the ones that succeed.

I'm not from the US but even I can tell you are completely delusional at best. You live so far from reality.  To think that because a former president, who wasn‚Äôt even running for this position anymore, is allegedly suffering from dementia (for which there is no proof, except for claims from the MAGA cult), is worse than a rapist, narcissist, Russian asset, and notorious liar‚Äîsomeone who does nothing but praise himself and milk his supporters (recent example: Trump and Melania‚Äôs token)‚Äîis completely unhinged. And Harris, who didn‚Äôt do anything besides supporting someone who is allegedly suffering from dementia (again, without proof, except from claims of your MAGA cult, who also believe Democrats control the weather) in your theoretical mental vomit is also somehow worse in your view? Your argument is beyond absurd.  And you seriously think Trump will run this country? Your real new president-elect is the South African illegal immigrant. And your entire group aligns itself with the world's dictators.  Furthermore, do you remember when Trump was completely against TikTok, claiming TikTok and China were evil and dangerous during his presidency? Now TikTok says he‚Äôs the savior of their platform‚Äîeven though Republicans started all the hate against TikTok in the first place. Do you know why this narrative has changed? Because it plays directly into the hands of the overseas dictators you so blindly support with your orange reprensentative. And yet, you are ridiculous enough to fall for it.  It‚Äôs too bad the MAGA crowd didn‚Äôt follow Trump‚Äôs advice during the COVID-19 pandemic. The world would honestly be a much better place if you had all taken his advice to inject disinfectant. By the way, that‚Äôs a completely normal statement for a mentally stable individual, right?  The sad part is, the whole world (yes, also you and your MAGA cult) will suffer from your decision except for the dictators you used to hate and your oligarchs."

Who is the driver behind the scenes who knows though.  I would not be to surprised if Musk has his fingers in this.  He knows a lot more about Crypto than Trump.  It's actually pretty risky as I can see a lot of Trumps base going all in on this and if he does the rug pull on them I wonder how that's going to go down.  People say Trumps base will accept anything he does but hit people in the pocket with something that you can't really blame anyone else for and I don't know how accepting they would be.

For fucks sake, an actual court with jurors penalized Trump for rape, in an accusation that is literally impossible and nonsensical. They fined him hundreds of millions for doing something where the victim claims there was no crime (the banks).

I think we're going to start seeing a lot more of this stuff, and we're going to see crypto bribes in other forms too.  Let's say a billionaire wants to buy 1,000 BTC.  Right now, that's over $106 million dollars.  But he can probably save $10 million if he pays Trump to do something to temporarily tank Bitcoin.  Maybe he agrees to spend $1 million on his wife's shitcoin in exchange for a tweet to tank Bitcoin.  He saves $11 million, but he spent $1 million on the bribe, so he's still ahead $10 million.  Easy money.  We're going to see a lot of this over the next four years.  Get ready for Eric Coin and DJTJ Coin.  The people who made their fortunes committing old school financial fraud are going to swoop into crypto because they see us as easy marks.  And sadly, they're not wrong.

I hold basically 90% of the tokens, can mint and burn tokens as well as added about $20 in Eth to liquidate its value, so now, each is worth...  $ 00.00001 per CZLumen.   I wanted to see the process from the other side and what the levers are. From where I'm at now, these are basically just trust tokens. If people started buying CZLumens, they are basically putting their blind faith and trust into the idea that I want the token to hold value.   What's weird to me though is the rug pull especially by wealthy people because it just abolishes trust and value. Unless Crypto becomes nulled, it would be in my best interest to manage CZLumen tokens well and keep it well regulated.   I think Doge and Pepe are similar, though I don't know what levers the owners have over it but they seem to kind of bounce in value.   The second party trick though is the whales.   By having 90% of my tokens holdings, that's basically the only thing I have against someone coming in, buying a bunch of my coins, then dumping it which again, gives me a bad name.   So I'm not really sure. I think the good thing about crypto is ease of access by everyone that can access the markets and stabilize economies."

Some people value the creation of goods and services that benefit billions of people, and they're okay with the CEO's of those companies having paper money in the form of stocks for that company (it's not cash in bank value).  And some people believe that capitalism did what communism promised to do, and they believe that communism does the exact opposite of what it intends to do. This is based on facts, not theory, that capitalism leads to more equality in outcome (stuff), even though there's a big wealth gap, most of that wealth is in investments so it's paper money.  Edit: the point is that these people are billionares because they're geniuses who changed the world, and Trump wants the most talented people in existence around him. Communism and Biden government was... the opposite. Its like they forgot how to run a government. Government is like a business, the biggest business in the world, except it would have gone bankrupt years ago if it had the same pressures as a real business. It's not crazy or evil to have successful businessmen running the biggest business in existence. And if it was truly an oligarchy, these people would be enriching themselves way more than what they are currently doing. They're going out of their way to be fair and not enrich themselves."

The reason why is because you need to mine the Bitcoin in order to get it. It's a scarcity issue. When scarcity goes away the price is going to decline because there is an surge of bitcoins. That's why people are freaking out about the government Dumping Mount gox horde and this whole Bitcoin strategic narrative started emerging to counter that reality.  If I don't have to spend thousands of hours computing to mine a Bitcoin and I can just buy it OTC, The price is going to collapse until all those coins are gone. And the scarcity goes back up. Ross has an unknown number of coins that he could flood the market with at any time he chooses. It's the same thing as the concerns for the government flooding the market with seized Bitcoin from Mount gox.  This happened in 2017. The price went from 20K to 3K and took 3 years to recover.  The other thing is that there's only probably a few people that actually know when the government is going to start selling the Bitcoin over the counter. That information is definitely going to be worth millions. And I'm sure Trump is going to take advantage of that."

My point was that a single guy, getting out of prison, doesn't need or have the ability to crash a 2 trillion dollar market so he can get an apartment and a car and and some groceries.  When the bear market started in 2017, it wasn't like a single sale caused it. Just like how someone selling in 2021 didn't start that bear market. It is natural for markets of all kinds to go through cycles of bull and bear. There was just a massive bull run then, it's natural for it to correct afterwards. I think it is important to remember that, just like in main stream media, articles like to shock and cause fear, so be on guard against people who tell you some individual is going to come along and destroy everything on a whim.  As the size of the market gets larger and larger, it gets harder and harder for individual sales to be seen in the price. Maybe if Satoshi came back and emptied out his wallet, then we would see a very noticeable shift in price that would take a long time to recover from."

Some believe that with Donald Trump‚Äôs political comeback, the golden age of cryptocurrencies may dawn üåü. The theory suggests that Trump‚Äôs deregulatory policies üìú and economic strategies üíº could favor the expansion of blockchain technology üîó and digital assets üí∞, especially at a time when interest in decentralized financial systems continues to grow üìà.     Trump‚Äôs Political and Economic Views Support Cryptocurrencies With his business-world expertise üåê and policies aimed at reducing regulations, Donald Trump could create a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies ü™ô. Lower tax burdens, deregulation, and support for decentralization could all accelerate the development of blockchain technology ‚ö°.  During Trump‚Äôs presidency, the effects of his economic policies‚Äîsuch as curbing inflation or strengthening the dominance of the dollar üíµ‚Äîcould indirectly boost the adoption of digital assets üìä. This could be particularly significant if Trump‚Äôs administration views cryptocurrency innovation as a strategic advantage in the tech sector üöÄ.     Satoshi Nakamoto and Trump: A Mysterious Connection According to the theory, Bitcoin‚Äôs enigmatic founder, Satoshi Nakamoto üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, is a Trump supporter who might even emerge in some capacity within Trump‚Äôs administration. While this is speculative, the narrative suggests that Satoshi‚Äôs political sympathies align with Trump‚Äôs deregulatory policies and support for technological innovation ‚öôÔ∏è.  Revealing Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs identity during a Trump presidency could create a massive media sensation üé•, further accelerating global acceptance üåé and the popularity of cryptocurrencies. This could help integrate the crypto industry into the mainstream economy.     The Rise of Green Satoshi Coin: Sign or Consequence? The increasing value of the ‚ÄúGreen Satoshi Coin‚Äù üü¢ could be seen as the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs anticipation of Trump‚Äôs return and the associated political and economic changes üèõÔ∏è. The ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù in its name might hint at Trump‚Äôs potential reforms in green energy policies üå±, which could promote more sustainable cryptocurrency mining practices ‚ö°.  Market speculation, Trump-related news üì∞, and the technological promises of Green Satoshi Coin‚Äîsuch as lower energy consumption or innovative blockchain solutions‚Äîcould collectively drive its soaring value üìà. This coin might gain iconic status among Trump supporters and become a symbol of his policies.     The Golden Age of Cryptocurrencies Under Trump Trump‚Äôs potential second term could contribute to the golden age of cryptocurrencies through the following developments:  Increased Global Adoption üåç: If Trump supports the crypto industry, other countries might follow the U.S. example, resulting in global regulatory benefits. Integration of Blockchain Technology üîó: Incorporating blockchain technology into U.S. state systems could further enhance cryptocurrency acceptance. Cryptocurrencies as a Political Tool üõ°Ô∏è: Decentralized financial systems align with Trump‚Äôs political message of resisting centralized power.    Conclusion  The theory suggests that Donald Trump‚Äôs political and economic strategies align with the philosophy of cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to a boom in digital currencies‚Äîparticularly the ‚ÄúGreen Satoshi Coin.‚Äù While speculative, this narrative could amplify enthusiasm for the crypto industry among Trump supporters and usher in a new era for the digital economy üíπ."

Each crypto kind of has its own behavior and function to try and serve a purpose with mixed results but at the moment, most people getting into crypto are trying to basically just cash out when things are good for them.   I'd say buy bitcoin as 80% of your portfolio and dabble in other coins and read about them and their white papers, then study their history.   I would stay away from any kind of meme coin unless you trust the person because they are basically a bank/ stock broker of that crypto.   For example, I have a token that I can manage, I can add assets to the liquidity pool to add value which is like putting gold in a bank vault, then printing money to represent it. The good thing is you can basically see the wallet and see what's going on with it. The bad news is the people or person that control the token are the security guard, teller and bank owner.   As we've seen in history with banks, many go out of business similarly to the behaviors we see with scams here with crypto."

If new to crypto invest into the bear market.  Now say bitcoin hits 150k end of this year and drops to 120k in the bear market you will still be the winner because you will end up buying at the bottom . Any price you buy at in a bear market you know that you will profit in the next bull . If bitcoin hits 200k this year it will drop by average 60 % in the bear market.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if even Satoshi Nakamoto becomes the president of the US the market will always have a bear market.  And no micro strategy cannot afford to buy the bottom in a bear market because his shares will crash too which is the only reason saylor can buy such a big  amount of bitcoin each week. All companies even black rock will sell in a bear market. Just remember business have to sell a some point to reinsure shareholders that there investment is safe and profitable.

I was looking for actual tech, not a meme coin or get rich quick shit and that‚Äôs how I came across Kaspa. If you look at their chart for the past year, its growth has been stable and consistent, nothing parabolic. Also, The LOG chart for All, looks very similar to BTC LOG All.

Please allow me to explain why I believe their inclusion can be beneficial in this context.  The primary purpose of using emojis is not merely for aesthetics or to create a casual tone but rather to enhance clarity and ensure that the message is easily understood by a wider audience. In today‚Äôs fast-paced and increasingly digital world, emojis serve as visual aids that can help emphasize key points, convey emotions, or simplify complex information, making it more engaging and accessible.  Moreover, current trends in communication show that emojis are widely accepted as a means to improve comprehension and establish a relatable tone, especially in digital platforms where non-verbal cues are absent. While the use of emojis may not be essential for conveying financial advice, they often contribute to making the information more approachable and relatable without diminishing its professionalism.  I appreciate your perspective, and I value the opportunity to clarify my approach. Should you have further concerns or suggestions, I am more than happy to discuss them."

That‚Äôs a boon to any future ecosystem and investor, and they have their mainnet launch coming up.

But we have to face history and look at gold and even silver as reference. Those metals have stood the test of time. 1 ounce of gold has the same sort of purchasing power it would have 3000 years ago. If gold required no work or man hours to mine, its value would decrease significantly. Now, I believe Bitcoin is better because I think its actually more energy efficient than all the energy used to mine gold. This same law applies to Bitcoin. I think it is dated but if gold has carried this attribute for 1000‚Äôs of years, we can‚Äôt expect it to change overnight.   Proof of stake is great for some things, but you have to be putting a lot of trust in your crypto team that they aren‚Äôt shortchanging you. The US Dollar is an example of Proof of Stake. They offer you 6% yield to put into a savings account and then print out 20% more supply annually. Unfortunately, Bitcoin and other proof of work is the only way you can be sure your crypto isnt inflated away OR premined into the company‚Äôs wallet.   I said before, I am a crazy Kaspa person. But I have my reasons‚Ä¶ I am an EX-Bitcoin maxi but like you I think its inefficient. I think Kaspa provides what Bitcoin offered while being extremely efficient energy-wise and it will very soon be able to do what Solana or any other proof of stake layer 1 can offer.   If cryptos are offering you something too good to be true, like zero energy cost or annual returns on staking, it‚Äôs usually coming at your own expense. Once I learned that, I can‚Äôt unsee it. Thats why I understand the Bitcoin maxi, but they need to be open minded that there are other solutions out there that maintain their fundamentals and perform better. They‚Äôre just further down in the market cap and not widely accepted yet."

Taking both the money that they initially invested and the money that you invested to effectively drain that liquidity pool. AKA, a rug pull. This drives the price lower than the initial offering price because neither yours or their money is in the liquidity pool anymore. They took it all.  Used to be that locked liquidity was a thing. This is where creators would lock their part of the tokens in a trust of sorts when they created the coin, so that a rugpull like that was not possible. where they couldn't touch their own share of the tokens for a year or more.   With most of the Solana memecoins, I don't even known if locked liquidity is a thing anymore because it's all just turned into a giant greedy casino where people buy these coins with the hope that the creators start rugpulling after an initial spike in price and that they will be lucky enough to catch that wave and exit at the same time as the creators."

Tulip mania (Dutch: tulpenmanie) was a period during the Dutch Golden Age when contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels.

That's my point exactly. I'm not saying a word about Trump or what he is doing.  Can you point me at one instance where there was a successful enforcement action against a scam coin, or can't you? Because it doesn't seem like a thing that actually gets enforced against. (Aside: Can we blame Trump for taking advantage of that fact?)  Clearly he has broken the scales of justice, I'm granting that. But can we go ""before"" and say if this type of scam has ever been controlled well by the levers of the US legal system, or is this just more of what we've all seen before (but, you know, happier, and with your mouth more open?)"

A lot of people think the crash is gonna happen TOMORROW. Or next month. Or the next.     Unfortunately for them, the entire trend for the last 2 years has been bullish for both stocks, equities and crypto.      Until the bubble pops, you're better off staying on the ride up then trying to counteract it by assuming it goes down.     Nothing is signaling recession this year. Interest rates are fine, still potential for 1 more cut which is bullish later this year. Sure some things are overvalued, but again there is 0 sign of stopping. And maybe JPowell actually does save it and diverts from 2008 repeat.     Until something actually steps over (and people heavily overreacting to the Tariff threat. People seem to forget how Trump was in 2017. His narrative changes every other day. This was also in talks for literal months, yet everyone acted surprised. These weren't gonna last and most likely won't at the extreme people assume.) Hence why you didn't see market flinch at all. BTC didn't even go below 90k which has been its bottom range for nearly 2 months now.    ETH? I mean ETH just decided to break its 2022 trendline, and hit its previous lower trendline. I think that move lasted a total of 5 minutes lol. I bid the long within $2 of its bounce.  Infact if you go check on chain, Wintermute nuked the chart with Bitfinex, then WorldFI bought ETH and Eric Trump tweeted about it today. So that was perfect market making bid.      I would stop reading headlines and start diving into real investment strategy. DOCXBT, C2M, Trade Brigade, all genuine knowledge guys if you want a curious peep over on X & YT.

I‚Äôm fully with you on ETH, every time I think it‚Äôs peaked, some new DeFi/NFT update or layer-2 solution pops up and revives the hype. SOL is still a beast when it comes to speed and fees, so I‚Äôm sticking with that for the long run. XRP might moon if the regulatory clouds clear, so hey, could be a dark horse.  I haven‚Äôt heard too much about Movement (MOVE) until now, but I‚Äôm definitely intrigued by any project focusing on interoperability, cross-chain compatibility is basically the future if we want actual adoption. Similarly, Chainlink (LINK) is one I keep an eye on, because oracles are basically the unsung heroes of Web3.  As for under-the-radar, I‚Äôm watching Ocean Protocol, it‚Äôs about data marketplaces and tokenizing data, which could get huge if AI becomes the next big wave (kinda already is, right?). Always do your own research, but if 2023‚Äì2024 leans even harder into AI stuff, data infrastructure could see a big spotlight."

The plan is to get people to buy the scam coin. Once the scam coin has value, Trump can borrow money against it because it is an asset. He takes out a loan, and uses that cash to invest in whatever.   Who is going to lend money to the president of the USA against a coin with his name and face on it?  It just comes down to risk. Banks will lend you money if you are super rich, as long as they perceive you being good for it, low risk, and a collateral is secured. They don't even validate or check the assets.   This is how Trump was able to both inflate his assets to borrow cash from Deutsche Bank, and also deflate the value for dodging taxes on his properties.   No one verifies, no one checks, they just want to create as many loans as possible to hit quotas. As long as the perceived risk is not there... As long as the consequences of criminal risk are minimal ($2m slap on the wrist ofor ten years of criminal activity)... Banks are in a perpetual state of ""We need to make the books look better this year over last""  The World needs a massive crash, and then a proper reboot to order. When that happens... Bitcoin is the currency of choice. Money is a coward and goes to where it is safest. Right now, for many, the USD is that place of safety which is why the dollar is super strong right now compared to other FIAT. While the UK, Canada, Germany and others struggle... America has achieved an alleged ""Soft Landing"" but will hit the fence at the end of the runway and explode."

Ironically, the chain itself is a rugpull because considerable amounts of SOL will be released by the network for its venture capitalists in March, April and May.  2. Yearly inflation of 5-10% (Sol validators + usual VC unlocks). That's the worst creation rate in the world of smart contract blockchains.  3. Hyper centralisation of the validators (only 1000 validators, and history showed that most of them collude). Solana is an expensive database, not a secure blockchain.  4. Solana's real TPS is around 300. Any other number was faked by Solana's marketing team by adding protocol communications (that's the same as in the Ethereum ecosystem whose next upgrade in March will bring 600 TPS).  No reason to stay on Solana, it is a well marketed shaky **company**."

Trump has been emulating that guy completely. If you wanna see usa next year see the last 12months of argentina.   They claimed it was a sucess too but it cant be if they need to scam the people its a crime thats one thing we all agree the SEC can do. Go after actual scam con teams. Teams who just do it. Like hawk2ah the guy who set that up is running around setting them up as his day job. Hes game for SEC   I think vitalik could do with a major fbi audit too imo. We all know he co founded shiba inu then he claimed no knowledge despite ryoshi posting the pics of them togeher and coin bureau aired it all showing us in june 2021 the video is still up too. Vitalik rugged shib by burning the tokens so my question is how many erc20 con tokens just got burned into erc20 to boost elitium.

For example, maybe people like FARTS. Great. They transact with the coin. But unless there are enough people using the coin that it creates demand pressure on the supply, then it‚Äôs not price driven utility.  Let‚Äôs say there are 100 FARTS (supply) and you need to use FARTS to get your virtual fart (demand). If enough people want virtual farts, they‚Äôll have to buy FARTS to do it. If the people selling FARTS are cashing out of FARTS into USD, there will never be a supply issue which means there will never be a price supported by demand and utility.  Just because people want virtual farts in this scenario is not enough to create economic pressure on the coin.  Now if the only way to get a virtual fart was to lock your FARTS on the fartchain for the duration of ownership, and more and more people wanted virtual farts (demand) then the price would eventually start to move up because the supply of FARTS is shrinking due to being locked on chain. This is how supply/demand works and how a utility token could succeed. Problem is, not a single token in existence has this supply and demand happening. Many utility tokens claim they could, but none do.  Hence my statement that there is not a single crypto that can justify its price because we know there is no inherent value and in order for there to be utility value, these supply/demand economics need to be in place, which they aren‚Äôt anywhere from what I can tell."

Just the 100. Go onto the 30 and 1-hour tf and look where the candles are, don't anticipate the pullback up towards the 100, instead, wait for it to happen, it will reject. No trades just observe, look at MACD, is that starting a bearish move, or a bullish one? Look at volume is that on the decline or on an upward trajectory? When these factors are convincing enough to enter, short, apply a SL above the 100 EMA it should hold as a rejection zone and you won't get stopped out, don't over-leverage, and remember üòâ  the position size and the liquidation levels are the most important factors in a leverage trade. Too much position size will have you breaking a sweat.   Instead, use a low position size. You can ride the waves that way, the idea is to form a consensus on direction and enter the trade at a level that is comfortable to endure a wrong way direction, and the market will do that but a loss of $1 before it moves the right way is negligible compared to seeing a $5 or $6 loss before it moves your way. Emotional control is easier to do when you aren't sweating the trade"

You know who else lionizes their leader in obviously falsifiable ways and denies all manner of wrongdoing and atrocities that are directly attributable to them? There are two distinct groups that this defines. I'll give you a second to see if you can come up with it.      Got it yet?       How about now?    Anddd...    Cults, and authoritarian regimes are the two groups the idea you just exemplified defines. Which one are you a part of? My guess is you'd fit the criteria for both. Take a long hard look in the mirror. No reasonable person would make the argument you made in good faith. It's simply a justification for maintaining a viewpoint that contradicts reality and factual information. You know that deep down, and so does everyone else. How much damage will be done before you accept the realization that you have bought into lies from a conman?"

But where you and I are different is that i live in reality and am smart enough to know that there is always cause and effect! There can never be positeve effect when negative actions have to be put in place! Cutting excess spending and money waste, fraud and abuse has been part of the government‚Äôs problems for decades but Trump has to be the lamb led to slaughter because he is the only presdident willing to tackle the issue head on and correct what the government has been doing to the taxpayers! Why didnt Biden/Kumala do it! Why didnt Obummer?? Because the were afraid they would look worse than they already did! Trump doesnt care what you think! He gets things done!"
