What are telltale signs of a pump-and-dump scheme? Was there a large frenzy created for the purchase of a stock/coin? One could argue that the president-elect who is followed by about 100 million people on X, 34 million on Facebook, 23 million on Instagram, 8 million on Truth, and around 3 million on TikTok. Assuming a good amount of overlap between all the platforms, I think it's safe to say that he has roughly 100 - 130 million unique followers (give or take a few million). On X, the announcement from Trump's account is sitting at 97.5 million views. I would say that's creating quite a frenzy, especially if you consider propagation of non-followers from followers.  Another sign is rapid growth of the value (the pump, if you will), it started at $7 a coin and reached a peak of $73 a coin. $30 billion worth has been traded in the last 24 hours and currently has a market cap of about $7.5 billion. The coin dropped two days ago, so that's pretty rapid growth.  The final sign is the rapid sell off of the coin by the largest stakeholders. Interestingly, 80% of the coin is held by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC. CIC Digital is owned by the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, of which Tump Jr is the sole trustee and Trump Sr is the sole beneficiary. So, while the ""dump"" has not officially begun, one can see the warning signs. The value of the coin is beginning to taper, Trump has officially been sworn in, and he plans to sign a lot of executive actions in his first 24 hours.   It's a pump and dump scheme, loud and clear. People are falling for it, which is sad but not uncommon, and no matter how much you don't want it to be true, it makes a lot of sense. Trump has never cared about anybody but himself, so why would this not be an easy way to make several billion dollars?",askconservatives

Fascists are socialists because they want to organize the society that way. Corporates are almost identical to syndicates, and corporatism is almost identical to syndicalism, which is a socialist ideology. The only difference between the two is that corporates include the employer and employees, while syndicates contain employees only. (In theory)   In reality, in fascist regimes the ""employers"" were/are at least partially controlled by the government, making them more similar to managers. (In USSR there also were managers, who even had higher wages). Plus, the corporates are the government...  Interesting fact, even wikipedia, which is very flawed in all political matters, acknowledges that fascism has a second name: national-syndicalism.  For modern fascism look at China, which is pretty much a fascist country, but with much less corporatism compared to fascist Italy. They still have the biggest trade union in the world, which probably has some power. China may seem like it is a capitalist country, but all big corporations there are either fully or partially controlled by government. Something similar was in Italy, where, if I remember correctly, around 70% of economy was controlled by the government, but there was also a limited free market. (Similar for nazi Germany).  There are other similar ideologies that noone can deny are socialist, such as ""guild socialism""  >have government control the means of production?  That's is the definition of socialism  >So 'fascism lite' is...socialist government pre capture by a dictator for the governments benefit?  It very well could be. If some dictator gets the power, it could turn into fascism or some other form of socialism.  >Thanks for pointing out gaps in my knowledge.
