He's promising that these are investments that will build wealth.  The only wealth they'll build is his own.  For everyone else it's just a false promise and a scam they'll lose money on.  He doesn't just say he's selling them a cool digital picture of himself that they might enjoy having.  He tells them it will make them rich.  He tells them they're making a sound financial decision.   It's incredibly scummy and predatory behavior.

A common scam is for people to create a coin and quickly ""pump"" the worth by investing a large amount before promoting it to other people who jump on board thinking it is a good investment.   Then the creator will ""dump"" the coin which tanks it's value. The creator and usually a small number of insiders will get a huge payday. The other investors end up losing their entire pay in.   Given that currently 80% of Trump's coin is owned by one wallet which is a common red flag of pump and dumps, and that Trump has made no promise or policy to not sell, it's foreseeable that one wallet is going to dump and tank the worth of the coin.

Because it seems like they think it's just a product.   It is supposed to be an investment mechanism. Except Trump made his own coin which the initial coins are owned primarily by the same wallet (80%). Which means someone clearly inflated the value before promoting the coin. And that someone is going to sell the minute they reach a certain threshold.  Which is going to essentially steal potentially millions from American people. With no return. There is no product. Literally just taking money and inserting it into his pocket. Not the pocket of the government, or any cause which may help Americans. Just Trump's pocket.   So why is that scam okay for a President to run?   And try to answer without going ""BUT WHAT ABOUT""  I oppose all insider trading and bullshit financial witchcraft that any Congressperson does and so should you. You voted for this guy because he was supposed to be different. Saying ""all politicians do that"" goes directly against the very thing you claim to support Trump for."

The 14th amendment makes that fairly clear. The idea that anchor babies are not subject to US jurisdiction is just not really plausible in any sense. Even saying illegal immigrants aren't subject to US jurisdiction isn't plausible in the common understanding of the word, nor the historical legal understanding of the word.

They didnt have the same concept of legal and illegal immigration that we do now. It was not as though they could deport people. However, the plain language of the text certainly covers both.  As for ""subject to their country's laws"" that's not really true even today. If I went to France and killed someone, I would get tried in a French court, I could not be tried in the US. Jurisdiction is geographical, it's not based on citizenship generally speaking.  Moreover, the child potentially being a citizen of their parents country (depending on if that country has bloodline based citizenship or not) wouldn't mean they aren't under US jurisdiction when in the country."

I’d have to disagree considering just 4 years before Biden won  by over 7 million vote and we’re just as divided now as we were then so I don’t think this past election was a landslide. ( fwiw I also think Biden election was a firing of trump vs an embrace of democrats, imo this election is the same just reversed) Especially considering that nearly 11 million Biden voters stayed home this time, if that vote share moved to trump I think the Dems would be in deep shit.   Also in AOCs district many folks split their ticket between AOC and trump. When asked after the election they said they liked them both because they view them as outsiders and they say whatever they think.   To be honest I think if conservatives continue to view this as a mandate they will alienate everyone except maga, especially as it’s unlikely the cost of living will do anything but go up based on his inflationary policies.   Most dems on the other hand are complacent and unwilling to have a spine in terms of their campaign talk vs how thy operate. After Biden was elected McConnell said his only goal was to thwart Biden’s agenda , and he was elected in a landslide. Meanwhile Dems are saying “ we will work with anyone” etc. After a razor thin election. If they keep doing this more folks will stay home, they do not know how to energize their base in the same way conservatives do. You cannot call someone a literal fascist then after the election say I will collaborate with them.   Imo both parties are on a see saw."

Fascists are socialists because they want to organize the society that way. Corporates are almost identical to syndicates, and corporatism is almost identical to syndicalism, which is a socialist ideology. The only difference between the two is that corporates include the employer and employees, while syndicates contain employees only. (In theory)   In reality, in fascist regimes the ""employers"" were/are at least partially controlled by the government, making them more similar to managers. (In USSR there also were managers, who even had higher wages). Plus, the corporates are the government...  Interesting fact, even wikipedia, which is very flawed in all political matters, acknowledges that fascism has a second name: national-syndicalism.  For modern fascism look at China, which is pretty much a fascist country, but with much less corporatism compared to fascist Italy. They still have the biggest trade union in the world, which probably has some power. China may seem like it is a capitalist country, but all big corporations there are either fully or partially controlled by government. Something similar was in Italy, where, if I remember correctly, around 70% of economy was controlled by the government, but there was also a limited free market. (Similar for nazi Germany).  There are other similar ideologies that noone can deny are socialist, such as ""guild socialism""  >have government control the means of production?  That's is the definition of socialism  >So 'fascism lite' is...socialist government pre capture by a dictator for the governments benefit?  It very well could be.

Which means any 'bribe' would not have a short term payoff and probably isn't a very effective mechanism for bribing, in most cases.  The counter argument to this is that while it's not untraceable, it does require active effort and analysis to track any suspicious activity so while it would come out, it probably would lag to some degree.  It's also not a clear rug pull. I could go into more details here but while there are some questionable aspects of it, it's not a rug pull the way that term is normally used in crypto.

Marbury v Madison is a GREAT opinion that everyone should read. Justice Marshall wrote this decision very careful. It was equally diplomatic, assertive and deferential. To give some context, our Constitution did not provide a guide nor reason why the executive branch would obey the judiciary. Each branch, prior to *Marbury*, could argue that itself was responsible for determining what the law is--like in England where the Parliament both makes the law, and determines what the law means. So Justice Marshall staked his claim, convincing the President that our constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land, that the judiciary alone decides constitutionality, and that the judiciary interprets the law.  “It is *emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is*. If two laws conflict with each other, the court must decide on the operation of each. The constitution must govern the case to which two laws apply.”  Invalidating that system would send us back 200 years and disgrace our founding fathers' ingenuity and brilliance."

How his actions ""feel"" doesn't matter.  Those feelings are influenced by people with grievances against Trump stoking fear about what he's doing.  The feelings don't necessarily reflect the reality of the situation.  The fact is Trump isn't really doing anything unprecedented.   >For example [...] denying the results of the 2020 election and continuing to deny them right up until Trump won in 2024.   Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams have done exactly the same thing with far less evidence, so that's not unprecedented or on another level.   >January 6th   Trump isn't responsible for the breaching of the Capitol.

Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.  If they cared about the issue of saying an election was rigged, they would have cared about it then too.  They should just be honest and admit they don't like *Trump* doing it.  >Would you say that calls to assess whether a known foreign adversary interfered in our electoral process is on the same level as outright denying the results of an election  I would say that the Clinton campaign making up and spreading false propaganda about the Trump campaign illegally colluding with Russia is pretty bad.  Trump's claims about the voting machines turned out to be false, and they were properly litigated just as they should have been.  His claims about states changing their election procedures in ways that allowed for widespread fraud and about the federal government and the media corruptly suppressing information that was damaging to the incumbent are verifiably true.  So yeah, I'd say the voting machines thing and the Russia collusion thing are on about the same level.  >inciting Jan 6th  This is just a factually incorrect claim.   > asking governors to ""find votes"" and publicly ostracizing them when they don't  Asking Governors to properly count all legally cast votes isn't bad, no.  Neither is applying political pressure to ensure that they do so.  >Deflecting criticism of Trump's actions as ""you're only upset now because it's Trump because here's a watered-down slightly adjacent example of the left doing something somewhat similar"" is, in fact, a way to justify Trump's actions.

Do you agree with the idea that anything that Trump does that could be viewed as negative is justified because the Democrats have either done the same or worse in the past?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/1jfu2kl/do_you_agree_with_the_idea_that_anything_that/,2025-03-20 17:16:12,3,2025-03-22 17:22:44,1,">How his actions ""feel"" doesn't matter. Those feelings are influenced by people with grievances against Trump stoking fear about what he's doing. The feelings don't necessarily reflect the reality of the situation. The fact is Trump isn't really doing anything unprecedented.  >Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams have done exactly the same thing with far less evidence, so that's not unprecedented or on another level.  I'd argue that objectively, no, Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams have not done the same exact thing at all. Hillary conceded the day after the election, Trump did not.  Hillary and Abrams never attempted to overturn the result or block certification of the election. These are objective facts.  >Trump isn't responsible for the breaching of the Capitol. He explicitly told the people there to ""peacefully and patriotically protest"" right before that happened.  Again, this is ignoring objective facts. Trump spent the months after the election leading up to Jan 6th claiming the election was stolen, pressured Pence to overturn the results, and had a speech immediately before the capital riot urging his supporters to ""fight like hell."" This isn't some media-driven rewrite of events, these are objective facts.  >Asking Governors to properly count all legally cast votes isn't bad, no. Neither is applying political pressure to ensure that they do so.  Once again, this is ignoring the objective facts. Trump didn't just ask to ensure that all legally cast votes were counted, he specifically asked the governor to find 11,780 votes, which were just the amount of votes needed for him to win.   I think it's important to look at these actions objectively and not just accept and re-iterate the talking points presented to us by media outlets."

It's a rhetorical use of the word that almost never means violence.  If you don't understand that, I'm sorry, but you're not a serious person.  The confirmation that Trump was using the words in this rhetorical sense is the fact that he specifically said to **peacefully** protest.  The fact that violence occurred later does not change what Trump obviously meant, unless you believe there was some conspiracy, and Trump didn't *really* mean to be peaceful.  If you believe that, you're just a conspiracy theorist reiterating media talking points like you said we shouldn't.  >he specifically asked the governor to find 11,780 votes, which were just the amount of votes needed for him to win.   There is no indication whatsoever that Trump was talking about illegitimate votes, so it doesn't matter how many votes he said to find."

Russia/Ukraine yes I think Trump is doing a better job than Biden did and same with Israel/Gaza.   4- I pretty much hate all EO and would much prefer Congress does their job but through several administrations (not just Trump) this has become a necessary evil.

My questions weren't about ""should conservatives vote for Trump versus a Democrat"" - that's a different conversation.  I guess I didn't do a good job setting it up but I'm genuinely curious about how conservatives feel about these specific policies on their own merits. Do you like the tariffs? Do you think DOGE is effective? Are you comfortable with the executive order count? These aren't gotcha questions - I'm trying to understand which parts of the agenda resonate with conservatives beyond immigration.  The strategic voting angle you're describing concerns me because it reduces policy issues to just ""red team vs. blue team."". Viewing politics solely as a strategic game where winning is everything opens a whole different can of worms. It fuels polarization, overlook policies that affect real peoples lives, it can lead to the abandonment of democratic principles to 'win the game,' and you might end up supporting poor policies you would otherwise oppose.  So to clarify my original question: I'm not asking ""should you vote for Trump or a Democrat?"" I'm asking whether you personally support these specific policies, and if immigration wasn't in the equation, which other policies would be your reason for supporting this administration?  If politics is just about strategic voting regardless of policy specifics, what's even the point of having policy discussions in the first place?"

You wrote: >I’m asking whether you personally support these specific policies…  But that doesn’t quite align with: >If immigration wasn’t in the equation, which other policies would be your **_reason_** for supporting this administration?  Those are two very different questions. The first is about isolated policy preferences. The second is about the justification for supporting the current administration.  I _assumed_ (correct me if wrong) your concern with the latter is what led you to ask the former (those six questions). That’s why I focused on that last one - to which my response was highlighting that people’s support for this administration **_is_** because of tribalism (red vs blue) and strategic pragmatism (increase chances to further conservative/right-leaning values).
