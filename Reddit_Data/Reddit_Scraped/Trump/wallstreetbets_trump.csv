Look at the whole H1B debacle. Were his supporters remotely capable of holding him accountable, *that* could have been a ""blood in the streets"" moment. Instead, there was 24-48 hours of denial and drama, followed by weeks of uniting around the idea of invading fucking Canada. It's like his supporters think the grievance was resolved because ""nobody's talking about that anymore.""  If there *is* any strong push back - like any enterprising cult leader - he'll simply disown and dissavow the dissenting parties, effectively expelling them from the community. This serves a dual purpose; not only does it directly quele the accute threat of dissent, it serves as a warning to others that dissent is equal to betrayal, and will be punished by banishment. It's such a powerful tactic too, as it's immune to things like status, or qualification, or even competing positive sentiment within the group itself.  Just look at General John Kelly, his Whitehouse Chief of Staff for 18 months, or Mike Pence, his friggin' VP, both of whom were rapidly dehumanized and cast out without so much as a fart from MAGA diehards. And it worked too! Just ask MAGA folks what they think about ""degenerate low-life"" John Kelly, or ""coward traitor"" Mike Pence.

If you have an immediate negative reaction just hearing the word crypto I would recommend just stepping back and maybe read or watch something about global finance in 2025.  Shit changes.

Hence, he needs to hold it low so that every new bribe launches pump and dump cycle you described.  3) He can use it for collateral, so he doesn't need to make money from bribes, because he can take loans against the coin. That can be still true, but feels off. Then it's actually better for it to be high so it's not that volatile, because banks will not like to give loans against a highly volatile asset. So then the bribery does not leave the coin, but point 1 still stands and imagine you get 500 mil from Russia just for degenerate traders to sell the coin because it's ATH and then the price goes back to what it was.  4) We are trying to get in the head of madmen who can do whatever he wants and has 100s of failed businesses with his name on it. I honestly have no idea anymore why it will go up or down. Yesterday we had a repost of the tweet from him; his son posted invest in crypto; it was on Fox News; it is now on all big trading platforms - nothing worked. I don't what else he needs to do for it to grow except to go on stage and scream ""Trump crypto coin goes to the moon/mats/into Uranus""  5) But he has 80% which he will want to sell for high price.

When you check the Trump coin, the amount of pooled Trump is approximately 100mill and pooled USDC is 500mill so no he didn't make billions.   Pooled USDC and pooled Trump represent the total amount of funds locked in the liquidity pool, which indirectly reflects how much money has been invested in supporting the trading of the Trump coin.  The market cap which you are clearly basing your presumption on is purely the theoretical value.   If you notice if someone spends 500 dollars on a shit coin with 200k market cap it will go up ridiculously higher in mc and you will see that increase is not proportionate to the 500 dollars someone invests."

The coin's features don't mean shit if it's not widely adopted. Like BTC is now pretty much the only one. Some might include ETH but that's about it.  Bitcoins tech is shit compared to most coins but nobody cares about your server hosting capabilities or some other useless shit that literally has no function in a modern world.  Seems like the #1 thing for smart contracts on different coins is to make another layer 2 coin on top of it.  Ethereum has been a thing for quite a while and I don't know any software that uses it.  $3k end of year is more likely.

What Trump did with his Meme coin was to get your money. The idea behind this is to make people believe he is Pro crypto and will make you rich however you need to not forget that he is POTUS now and he needs cash asap to show his opponents he did his MAGA. The best way to do get that cash is to play with crypto, create one, make it go high and then crack it when it gets enough cash. Sooner or later Bitcoin will face the same. I believe him and Blackrock will make Bitcoin go so high by buying most of it and once they get your cash they will devalue it. My opinion know when you cash out and don‚Äôt be too hungry. Blackrock and classic banks will never let crypto kill a money system they created since centuries so sooner or later they will want to control it and eventually destroy it."

Eth also hasn't moved for so long and the same thing is true for pepe, so expecting a big pump on pepe soon."

Doge was basically *the* original memecoin and started to go way up in 2021 immediately after GME went viral and everyone seemed to be looking for something silly to put $100 on and become a millionaire. Peanut the squirrel and the chill guy meme were all over social media for a few weeks a couple months ago. Those memes had time to take off and build organic attention, and the coins created for them were similar, I believe both of the coins created for those latter two peaked 3-4 weeks after the meme started, and if you bought within the first week or so, you made pretty strong gains.   Compare that to the coin OP is talking about, which peaked within a few hours. The coin peaked at 400m market cap, but it could have peaked at 4m, or 4b, and everything in between too. The average Joe is looking for a 100x every time, where the big fish OC is talking about are happy to pull a 10-20% return and take their money out. That‚Äôs a huge psychological advantage, and you feel that if you‚Äôve ever thrown down any sort of money on one of these things and lost it. It goes without saying, never invest more than you can afford to lose, but even if you‚Äôre only down $20, you feel defeated, scammed, and hustled, it makes you sick"

The Bitcoin Legionnaires have enslaved the world. Making Laughter illegal.  Then one day BUTToshi Nakamoto used the power of the TushFlow to forge the First Buttcoin. BUTToshi's new Currency - The Currency of Laughter quickly spread across the realm, from which the Knights of Cheekwoods Grove rose to Stand against the evil Michael Saylor and the Bitcoin Legionnaires.   Tales of epic battles. Hilarious tales of the creation. We have a WordPress blog of stories and Lore. YouTube videos (so funny) and absolutely amazing art.  (The Donald Rump character was just born out of the recent events IRL)  SO again. I know you all only buy coins to profit, so do I, mostly. $BUTT every once in a while something comes along with a different form of Value.   After the 5 years I've been through. Laughter is VERY rare for me. It's been refreshing to smile and laugh everyday again.   BUTTCOIN = LAUGHTER LAUGHTER = WEALTH"

There are real projects that provide value because they aren't trying to compete with Bitcoin, but rather, they solve other problems in novel ways.  They are usually very long term investments though, because being a value investor in a space as new as crypto means that market sentiment could take years or decades to catch up to the level of understanding of developers and the rare few who actually understand what a given crypto can do (which frankly, is almost nobody. Even 90% of Bitcoin investors can't clearly explain what blockchain does, and that's not even getting into things like web3, smart contracts, and oracles)"

I'm not sure you understood my comment. The cryptos are offering the better, cheaper services to these financial institutions.  >I still feel crypto is more a solution looking for a problem than anything else. Transformative technology tends to get picked up quickly with little need for promotion. Crypto hasn't really gone anywhere in terms of adoption as means of exchange in 15 years.  This is word-for-word what many people said about the internet. Nobody understood what it was good for when we already had radio, television, telephones... yet here we are.  It very common for new technologies to not even have clearly intended uses when they are created. Even so, some of the uses for DLT, blockchain, and consensus computing in general have already been discovered and big players are using them or beginning to use them on an incredible scale as we speak.  No offense intended, but I get the feeling you don't really know much about blockchain and just assume it is only good for ""crypto"" that has no function besides being bought and sold. That is just not the case."

The whole world crypto market cap is like $3T at this point and we are basically ATH, while the US GDP for 2024 is \~ $30T   I wouldn't want to be in crypto at all at this point, I would rather stay in cash/USDT as the sentiment is lunatic. 80% sees the BTC as bullish and that's always a sign shit is about to hit the fan.   As soon as you hear delivery guys are buying crypto it's time to pull out as they are the very last adopters and bag holders by default. There are no greater fools to buy at higher prices after them."

Including slow rug pull. Which is exactly the above. If you are a gambler that ‚Äúinvests‚Äù in trump and other shitcoins. Sorry to say, you are much better off paying a broker and taking a smaller cut in the long run.   Also, the 0.01% of people that make money of crypto, is not the general rule that the common investor should ever follow.  The promise of making a lot of money in a short amount of time is a pure lie, usually made by people who really do make that, by taking your hard earned money.  p.s, with the amount of money I invest via brokers, I actually do know how much profit they take, but in the 15y of doing that, and seeing the value for return for just seeing a bigger number with each passing year ~10%, I absolutely love the 0 hassle I have in the matter.

And I wish you the best of luck.  IUL has nothing to do with it, my broker invests my money into stocks, I decide the amount of risk I want to take in comparison with return. Low risk, low returns and vice versa.   Unlike some, I'm not lying to myself that I know that one coin will do better tomorrow in comparison to another.  Same with stocks, which is why I trust other companies to do that for me, and yield beautiful profits imo on an annual basis.  But unlike shitcoins (which imo are all of the coins that have no purpose/utility), stocks are for companies with actual value in the market, that have actual products that you probably use in your day to day basis.  I know how to make money off my knowledge in other areas and expertise, and manage 2 sucessfull businesses. Gambling is not one of them.  And last, making money is not my purpose in life. Building something that will last for generations is.  Money is a means to an end, and ever since I have switched my thought process to that, life not only became simpler, but my monthly pay check raised exponentially over the years‚Ä¶.to the point that these days, the number lost all meaning.  Thanks to that I'm now in the process of entering the next level of the universal rat race, where I will invest my money into real estate, and start making profit off that as well, and the most beautiful thing, is that I don't even need to take any loans nor mortgage. Yes I might not be a billionaire, nor will ever be, but I am content and go to sleep happy :)  Say or think what you will, but if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing just for the sake of ‚Äúmaking more money‚Äù.  Cheers and good luck in your future endeavors."

The portfolio is diversified across several cryptocurrencies, including large caps like Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, and Cardano (ADA), as well as mid to smaller projects like Trump (TRUMP), Akash Network (AKT), and ResearchCoin (RSC).  Observations:  1. Balanced Mix of Large and Small Caps:  Bitcoin (BTC) dominates the market and provides stability.  XRP, Chainlink (LINK), and Cardano (ADA) are well-known projects with strong fundamentals.  Smaller coins like Trump (TRUMP), SuperVerse (SUPER), and LCX add speculative growth potential.    2. High Volatility Exposure:  Some holdings, such as SuperVerse (-7.94%) and NEAR Protocol (-6.01%), are experiencing sharp declines.  A few, like Immutable (IMX) and LCX, are showing small gains.  Bitcoin (BTC) is down 1.60%, but still holding above $95,000, which is significant.    3. Potential Risks and Opportunities:  Trump (TRUMP) has a high price per coin but is down 7.38%, suggesting recent volatility.  ResearchCoin (RSC) and SuperVerse (SUPER) seem more speculative.  WiFi Map (WIFI) has a very low price but a large quantity, which could be a high-risk, high-reward play.    4. Notable Absences:  No Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL), which are strong blue-chip cryptos.  No stablecoins (USDT/USDC), meaning they are fully exposed to market swings.     Overall Verdict:  This portfolio leans heavily on mid to high-risk altcoins, with Bitcoin providing some stability.  If the altcoin rally continues, there‚Äôs strong upside potential‚Äîbut if the market crashes, many of these could suffer significant losses.  Would be interesting to know the investment thesis behind the smaller holdings like ResearchCoin (RSC) and Trump (TRUMP).  ... Chance of 100k ...  The possibility of this portfolio reaching $100K depends on several factors, including market conditions, Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory, altcoin performance, and macroeconomic influences. Since it's been a two-year portfolio, let‚Äôs break down the potential scenarios.   ---  1. Key Factors Affecting Growth  Bitcoin's Market Cycle:  Bitcoin tends to lead the market, and if BTC reaches $150K‚Äì$200K in the next bull run, altcoins could see exponential growth.  Historically, altcoins pump after BTC stabilizes at new highs.   Altcoin Season Potential:  Altcoins tend to outperform Bitcoin in speculative bull runs.  Coins like Chainlink (LINK), Injective (INJ), Cardano (ADA), and IMX have strong use cases and could surge.  High-risk coins (Trump, ResearchCoin, and SuperVerse) could either explode in value or become illiquid.   Tier 1 Exchange Listings:  If WiFi Map (WIFI), SuperVerse (SUPER), or Trump (TRUMP) get major exchange listings, their value could skyrocket.   Regulatory Environment & Market Sentiment:  XRP‚Äôs ongoing legal issues could affect its price.  Increased institutional adoption (e.g., Spot Bitcoin ETFs) could boost overall crypto valuations.     ---  2. Growth Potential Based on Past Performance  Bitcoin: If BTC moves from $95K to $200K (2x) ‚Üí Other altcoins could 3x‚Äì10x.  Chainlink (LINK) was $50 in 2021; if it returns to ATH (~2.5x).  ADA has previously hit $3+, which would be a 4x move from here.  Smaller caps (Trump, RSC, WIFI) are more speculative, but some could go 10x if they get the right exposure.   If some of the lower-cap coins see a 5x-10x run, combined with Bitcoin doubling, this portfolio could cross $100K.   ---  3. Realistic Scenario Projections   ---  Conclusion:  Yes, this portfolio has the potential to reach $100K, but it depends on:  1. Bitcoin‚Äôs bull run (if BTC crosses $150K, altcoins will likely follow).   2. Altseason kicking in (some of these altcoins need 5x‚Äì10x moves).   3. Holding through volatility (2025 could be the peak of the current cycle).    If you‚Äôre patient and willing to ride 2025‚Äôs potential market peak, this could hit $100K or more‚Äîbut taking profits along the way is always a smart strategy.  Would you consider reallocating or adding anything, or are you set on holding?"

Low market cap (under 100M) rather than low unit price actually has the potential to create life changing money for you if you remain disciplined and vigilant.  In addition, in order to win in the crypto space you need to become familiar with the tokenomics of each project you invest in and in most cases their white paper. Lastly, rather than holding assets on centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, ect you need to immerse yourself in the decentralized side of crypto and participate in the DEXs, Liquidity Mining, Staking, and Airdrops. This will dramatically decrease your transaction fees and expose you to many passive income opportunities.   There‚Äôs much more I could add, but this should be enough to get you started. One more thing‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt forget to join the communities of the projects you believe in most (Reddit, X, Telegram, and Discord). Your crypto journey will always be more fun/profitable when you aren‚Äôt alone and find like-minded individuals as well as when you establish direct lines of communication with the devs of these projects."

Bitcoin is the safe and most likely crypto to get anyclose to 10k.... that is if you either already had a around 4-6k invested near to the last halving date.  Atom went near to 10$ a couple weeks back. It will probably go back up again and maybe even double in price. You can go all in atom. The greatesr think about cryptos like atom is you stake it for returns. So you earn a couple more coins while waiting for it to go up.  Same with eth/sol. Sol and eth recently went down. Will go up again. Catch the dip and gain.  Doge is pretty low and it's been going down over 30% the past month at  0.36$ to 0.25$ it will go back up.  If you swap and hold a thousand or so if doge went up 10 cents, you'd make 100$. Buy 10k doge, that's 1k$."

BTC as base and security is graat but u have too many shit coins - ADA/ICP/XRP/MATIC/LCX - for massive gains you need coins with lower market cap too and most coins you hold have high market cap and no catalyst to drive price and excitement. If you want maximise ur gains get coins that ppl are excited about and have upcoming things that people want speculate on.    Categories to consider RWA/AI and larger meme coins like PEPE/DOGE

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just about quick gains. it‚Äôs fundamentally about preserving wealth due to its scarcity. Many people focus on the potential for massive short-term returns, but the real strength of Bitcoin lies in its ability to store value over the long term, especially in an inflationary world.  Looking at a 10-year horizon instead of chasing quick riches, Bitcoin still has significant growth potential. With a market cap of only around $2 trillion, there‚Äôs plenty of room for expansion, especially if more institutional investors, index funds, and pension funds recognize its value. A 4x increase isn‚Äôt unrealistic in that context and this will still put the value under gold.  Saying Bitcoin is ""too expensive"" is misleading, it‚Äôs priced at what the market deems fair, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt continue to appreciate. The key is understanding its long-term value rather than just chasing short-term price action."

You may get to 100k but you also may not. Your best bet is to Consolidate your holdings into the 2 - 4 strongest cryptos. Don‚Äôt rent conviction from others, find your own. I say this with emphasis as you need to have an understanding of the crypto you‚Äôre investing in. Invest a very small % of your overall holdings into meme coins as they are extremely volatile. Keep most of your overall % holdings into the strongest cryptos.   Tips: more mature crypto‚Äôs that have been through multiple cycles such as Bitcoin & ethereum are lower on the risk curve as they have matured in the market. Newer crypto‚Äôs such as Solana will provide higher returns as it‚Äôs higher up the risk curve. SUI will likely outperform Solana as its even higher in the risk curve as its newer in the market which means its less mature. This is just an example, not a recommendation to invest into these coins.  If you re-allocate all your holdings into a couple of strong alpha assets that are likely to outperform bitcoin such as Solana and Sui you are likely to get closer to your goal. This game is about risk management.  My experience: when I first started buying crypto currencies in 2017 I was a total beginner and would buy everything based off recommendations from others and do minimal research into what I was buying. This was a mistake. When you learn to build your own conviction you are more likely to hold onto the coins for the longer term. You are also more likely to buy more frequently, building up a solid base before a bull run.  By doing this I‚Äôve turned ¬£10k into ¬£97k the past couple of years. I have the bulk of my portfolio in 3 major cryptocurrencies. Less than 5% are in meme coins (mainly for fun) I don‚Äôt dabble in meme coins much as it‚Äôs impossible to predict and highly risky.   It‚Äôs important to remain level headed and unemotional in this game. Look at the data and facts and educate yourself how and why the markets react the way they do. The last thing you want to do is base your decisions on friends‚Äô and social media‚Äôs opinions on crypto. Like I said above. Don‚Äôt rent other peoples convictions, find your own."

They did it once, and discussed doing it again for the recent bybit hack.  Bitcoin is the only legitimate asset. Period.   Only bitcoin has network effect, one-shot-principle, and the immaculate conception. Bitcoin is the coin of consensus. It is the digital money that enemies can agree on.

There's a significant difference between getting user permission to push through a change to make it how it was always suppose to be, vs leadership unilaterally changing the ledger.  Network effect, one-shot-principle, immaculate conception. Absolute scarcity.  Edit: To put a finer point on it, Satoshi fixed a bug that made the inflationary blocks invalid. They didn't roll back the chain as much as fixed the consensus mechanism, and the node layer (end users) adopted the change by running the updated code. Those blocks *should have been* invalid. Ethereum, on the other hand, unilaterally rolled back *valid* blocks as a favor after a hack."

As a hardfork, it represents an inflation of supply, which is the opposite of scarcity. And scarcity is fundamental.  It doesn't have network effect, or [immaculate conception](https://x.com/danheld/status/1047884852454862849), and it violates the [one-shot-principle](https://x.com/knutsvanholm/status/1321312150137278464).  If we take litecoin into consideration, we have to consider bitcoin cash, bitcoin satoshis vision, bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond, and all the hard forks, etc etc. Scarcity goes out the window and with it, the value proposition of the whole market.  There is no long term place for hard-forks. They will only be the temporary refuge of contrarians who bet against consensus, and with so many alts to chose from, those communities are far more likely to dissipate in entropy, and once growth stagnates, they will start to dump and disintegrate.

The bitcoin network is more than the technology, it is a social phenomenon, and these two parts are inseparable.  Lets say another crypto does take over and become the new king. It has better technology, more transactions per second, best memes, wow much improved.  This sets a clear precedent. Technology beats network effect. And before you know it, this new chain is looking kinda old too, as the next generation arrives,. and on and on..  And you end up with an economy of perpetual turnover, which decimates confidence as a store of value. Serious investors turn back to monetizing gold, stocks, and real estate.  People want a secure, long term store of value. Something they can believe in. And bitcoin is the obvious choice. The only rational choice. So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Do \*not\* discount network effect. That is why we get stuck with protocols like TCP/IP or standardization like USB. Both have evolved over the years, but have also remained backwards compatible; true to their roots. Just as Bitcoin evolves with Lightning, Taproot, and the technologies to come like Eltoo and Channel Factories, but Bitcoin, and thus all of it, remains forever compatible with the early UTXOs.  Bitcoin is not Myspace or Facebook. Bitcoin is TCP/IP. Bitcoin is USB. It is the new standard in money. And its a game where everybody who plays wins, and everyone who doesn't, loses, so it's going to become more clear as time goes on that 98% will eventually have bitcoin, just as 98% now have smart phones."

If everyone starts selling and the price is driven down, then what you sell for will drop, bc of the MARKETPLACE of exchange, not because someone STOLE people‚Äôs money.  If the price drops to $1000 and a bunch of buyers come back in, they don‚Äôt have nothing on their hands. They have bitcoin. And if the price rebounds (as it has MANY times in the past which is why it has yet to go to zero) the buyers who bought can sell their bitcoin for a higher price.  Tulips wilt.

I would say if you ever do have an appetite to come back, sticking to the main established coins is the best bet and just treat it similar to an index DCA strategy, putting a bit in every week/month/paycheck and ignoring short term gains/losses and fluctuations and focus on the long term.
