The 800M Trump wallet still seems to have 800M. You need to actually dump your coins to be a pump and dump. And there's also a vesting schedule. Price just retraced from +40,000% to +26,000% where it was a few hours ago.   Melania is her own person and is free to make her own separate coin. I'll acknowledge she might not be the best ICO timer in the world. But if you wanted a pump & dump you'd have done the opposite to maximize the amount of time to extract liquidity. Ideally waiting until after it got listed on major CEX's.   I don't think most of the people commenting on this have traded—let alone even have an on chain crypto wallet or used a dex screener."

But the other side is that people are happy to support him by giving him money. It’s like when truth social went public and the stock was pumped high probably due to regular people buying into it as a form of donation. Or the NFT thing he did a few years back.

There doesn't appear to be any deception behind it.  I don't have a problem with it and I think it's cool that he is open to these kinds of things, and I am glad he is generally receptive to the crypto community."

Here's the thing about meme coins, they are a thing because they monetize the energy that is ""virality."" instead of it dissipating, it turns into an asset. Trump isn't a typical meme, though, he has staying power. At some point that becomes an asset. People have made plenty of money off of it. People enjoy the novelty of owning some Trump meme coin and some ppl purely use it speculatively. No one trading crypto meme coins is going in thinking he's getting in at the ground floor of Apple, though. It's basically a casino game or you're in it to just hold the merch because you like the novelty. I know NTS suddenly care deeply about the financial health of speculative meme coin traders who voted for Trump but, again, there is nothing shady about this."

If you sell a tshirt to someone,  while you recieve money, the t Shirts you have aren't going to increase in value. With every coin sold in the beginning, the value of trumps 80% he holds, rises. And all pump and dumb meme coins protect themselves with the disclaimer, that they aren't an investment,  while they obviously do everything to look like an investment.    And why does trump seem to constantly need money? He is the president, right? He gets a salary. So why isn't He just selling tshirts for example,  where the person buying it has an actual item, that they can wear. What's the upside of a meme coin to show Support, for the people that buy them? They can't show it around or anything and they essentially just gift money to the president.   And are you concerned about the fact, that this crypto would be a pretty easy way to funnel money into trumps pockets or make him biased in his policies towards crypto? And I dont even mean it willingly. If you made alot of money from crypto, you will obviously be biased towards it even if you try to stay impartial.

I’ve never said we should cut off aid to Ukraine. I just don’t think it’s fair to say that Trump is advancing Russia’s interests or is somehow becoming a part of a Kremlin psych-op by trying to 1) bring the parties to the table and 2) rejecting the unfounded and misguided confidence that Ukraine can somehow win this war.   The biggest criticism of the American role under Biden is we were giving aid with no clear goals. That is still the case. The reality is Ukraine cannot win the war based on our financial or material alone. Unless they get more manpower, they will lose this war of attrition. I don’t want that anymore than the next guy. Nor do I want the U.S. to send its troops.   If the Europeans want to send their troops to go fight, they are more than welcome to and I would support US aid to that effort."

At no point in the Cold War was the US able to fully dictate terms to the USSR or the PRC.   With the end of the cold war came a (brief) period of true US hedgemony where its status as the world reserve currency and as such the singular world superpower went unchallenged for about 25-30 years. Since the war in ukraine the US has tried to bankrupt Russia by using the same financial sanctions we have used to crush other nations currencies in the post cold war years by preventing the russians from properly servicing their debt.  lt didn't work.  Russia under Putin has rebuilt a self sufficient suply chain in its reduced borders and has been able to float his currency with its own jerry rigged version of the petro dollar.  For better or worse the US is now not able to fully dictate conditions to other superpowers as it once did. Once again (as in the cold war) we have to negotiate with the Russians just like JFK did durring the cuban missle crisis.  The only alternative is going to war with the russians and the following nuclear anihilation of the planet.

The US spends far more on defense in absolute terms than other NATO members, but is only the third highest spender as a % of GDP.

Of course military spending would decrease during this time, especially after how much nations spent during the Cold War. It decreased in the US for over a decade until 9/11 and Iraq. Then decreased again from 2010 until the Trump presidency.    And now that war in Europe is looking increasingly likely, military spending is ramping up accordingly. Every NATO country increased spending since 2014 by double digit percentages. 15/32 members increased it by 100% or more.

If the committee investigates and finds he fabricated this and it is ""fake news"" as you indicate, he actually DOES face some significant penalties.  I strongly encourage you to read his disclosure. The fact that he submitted detailed information and documents to an official government agency makes this VERY different. We have public receipts for his claim that can very easily be disproved if he is lying.   Here are just some of the consequences he could face:   **Criminal Penalties for False Statements to Congress: 18 U.S.C. § 1001** Making a knowingly false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement to any branch of the U.S. government, including Congress, is a felony. Penalty: Up to 5 years in prison and/or substantial fines.  **Perjury Charges** If the whistleblower lied under oath or under penalty of perjury (which his declaration explicitly states), he could be charged with perjury. Penalty: Up to 5 years in prison.  **Obstruction of Congressional Proceedings 18 U.S.C. § 1505** Obstruction of Proceedings Before Departments, Agencies, and Committees Intentionally obstructing or impeding a Congressional investigation can also trigger separate felony charges. Penalty: Also up to 5 years in prison.  **Loss of Whistleblower Protections** Whistleblower protections (such as from retaliation or threats) are only valid if the whistleblower is acting in good faith. If Berulis is found to have knowingly fabricated or misrepresented facts:  * He would lose all legal protections. * He could be fired immediately. * He could be sued civilly by parties he accused (for defamation, damages, etc.).  **Civil Lawsuits** Agencies or private individuals/entities named in the disclosure (DOGE, NLRB leadership, etc.) could sue him for defamation if they can prove he knowingly made false claims with malice or reckless disregard for the truth. Potential damages: Financial ruin.  **Personal Fallout** Destroyed career (especially in IT/cybersecurity and federal work). Permanent public reputation damage. Possible security clearance revocation (if not already lost).  Do you disagree with the above and that he faces any sort of consequences if he is lying?  Do you think this should be investigated either way?"

To directly answer your question: * Immediate foreign login attempts (from Russia) within minutes of DOGE account creation, using valid credentials. * Deletion of critical system logs during the window of suspicious data activity — logs required for auditing. * Disabling of Azure Network Watcher and other monitoring tools, preventing collection of audit evidence. * Root-level (“tenant owner”) access granted without standard request, approval, or justification records. * Massive 10GB+ outbound data spike with no associated business activity or explanation logged. * Manual modification of security policies (e.g., disabling MFA) without approvals or documentation. * Suppression of the internal recommendation to escalate the incident to US-CERT, halting external forensic investigation.   Audit processes rely on intact logs, monitoring, and transparency. When those are disabled, deleted, or blocked, no audit process can fully explain or validate what happened. Only a full independent investigation could.   If critical systems were disabled, audit trails erased, and an internal investigation was blocked.

Should tax information be stored somewhere other than the IRS, or military information be stored somewhere other than the Pentagon?    If so, how does storing it somewhere else make it MORE efficient, and more importantly, more secure, to access and use as needed?  Storing it somewhere else, to me, seems more inefficient.

It's the same old boogeyman story they've been selling for a decade. They cried wolf one too many times to take it seriously.

I think it'll likely never die. It'll be like a second JFK shooter - doesn't matter what the evidence is, some percentage of people just really really want to believe it. It doesn't matter that the authors say the ""report reaffirms Special Counsel Mueller’s finding that President Trump did not collude with Russia"", which at least the lawfare article has the sense to point out. Nope, minds are made up and won't be changing."

But the president not colluding with Russia is not the same as Russia did not interfere and did not try to get Trump elected. The senate found they absolutely 100% did with facts and clear convicting evidence reported.   Therefore ie and ergo - Russia interfered in 2016 election. That is what they found.   I will grant Trump did not collude. Fine.   Russia did interfere and it was not a hoax.  Do you see that I mean?

They put resources —beyond just hopes and prayers— toward that interference.

Would DOGE have any legitimate reason to configure this in your mind?
