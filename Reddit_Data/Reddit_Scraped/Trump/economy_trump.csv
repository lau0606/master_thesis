On that last one, RDDT offered its IPO to us users. Did you buy? If you did you beat the market a few times over this year.   Every company listed above in the 5yr range were and are obvious buys. The problem isn't that people don't know which sticks to buy. The problem is most people don't have the money to invest. Additionally people get greedy and look for long shots. A smart investor that starts with millions to invest can pretty easily beat the market year or year. No insider trading required. Again, all the stocks lost above on the 5yr line are obvious. Likewise, RDDT's IPO was obvious."

Yes, that's right, _this is your fault._ And mine. We are the problem, collectively, all of us, and until we as a society collectively get our acts together and start improving things or everything collapses, whichever comes first, the current trajectory is all you can expect.  Keep blaming ""them"" on the other side of your political tribe and holding yours up like they and you are pious.

Nobody cares anymore.  Trump has committed 1000 infractions that would have been the end of the political career for any other politician but it doesn't stick to him at all.  Even the worst pols have some sense of decency and will fumble their self-defense knowing that they're in the wrong, Trump double-downs and lies, threatens, blackmails even more and gets his way.  Getting his way due to those very other pols who are so spineless they let him bluff his way through reality instead of facing any consequences.  I'm tired of hearing of the latest Trump lawlessness knowing there will be no repercussions.  What, do we think it'll magically be the one thousand and first criminality that gets him?"

Then in his third term he will actually destroy the Sith/drain the swamp. Somehow Barron will be the one to convince him to fulfill the prophecy.   ^^^^/s

Trump, knowing that crypto was a scam and that his token was fraudulent still went out and created it, premined / granted himself the majority of it, then promoted it and the returns you'd get - AKA deception.  In other words, while Bitcoin is fucking stupid and there are many frauds perpetrated with it, no one owns it or premined it and there's no one who created it literally as a fraudulent act / with intent to commit fraud - it was just a dumb experiment. They didn't deceive people as to its origins, ownership, or value. Trump's creation and promotion of his coin on the other hand is itself a blatantly fraudulent act."

And besides, I was told the deficit is way too high. Tax cuts ain't gonna help. Republicans need to get on that deficit, pronto."

Raise my taxes? Fuck off with that.  Maybe actually start enforcing taxes on the 1%? Please do.  It’s funny because there’s levels to this. I believe my household income sits in like the 94th percentile. But when you get into other percentiles it starts jumping exponentially. Like literally if my house hold income is like $280k, the next percentile up is like $500-600k, then it goes to like $900K-1.2M, then like $4M+  When you’re knocking on that door and realize how good you have it STILL pales in comparison to the uber rich, it’s laughable.  making these dudes at the absolute top pay their fair share would solve the problem. But hey, typical world we live in, make everyone in the middle class and everyone in the lower class hate and fight each other while Bezos is busy forcing foreign governments to expand canal bridges for his super yacht.

The problem was that the amount that they wanted to forgive was likely way more than the original authors of the law likely intended to be done with one pen.   Then again the original authors probably didn't expect a $1.5 trillion debt in student loans to be a thing.

Then they could implement a social credit score (like you mentioned in china) and make you have to follow rules to use the economic system.  So that is how if you protested in a non approved way they could shut down your account (like they did in the trucker protest of canada).

Let me explain to how this works bud.   This executive order still matters because it bans the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency.. If the government wanted to move forward with a digital dollar, this order stops that from happening. So even though the Fed is independent, this policy makes it clear that a CBDC is off the table. It’s about limiting the direction the government could take with digital money in the future.

The executive order actually does matter because it sets the President’s stance and prevents any future steps toward creating a CBDC. The Fed might control monetary policy, but the executive branch can still influence the direction of financial policy. The President can’t directly make a digital dollar, but he can set priorities for agencies like the Treasury, which can affect what the Fed does. So, this order essentially stops the government from moving forward with a digital dollar. The executive branch may not create one, but it definitely has the power to block it.

I did a bit of addictional research and it changed my view of the order and my understanding of CBDC's.  For those that follow...  1. CBDCs are centralized, government-controlled digital currencies designed to function as legal tender.  2. Limited Focus: The order is narrowly tailored to target state-backed digital currencies rather than decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  3. No Mention of Decentralized Cryptocurrencies: There is no direct language suggesting any regulation, restriction, or control over decentralized assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.  On the whole, the order appears to be an initiative for the US government to formalize addressing digital financial technologies and products in order to protect the monetary system."

Musk is a national security threat of the highest order and must not be permitted to have access to America's bank. Similarly, Musk must be prevented from exploiting America's data.  Musk's DOGE was conceived to skirt disclosure requirements and vetting of China businessman Elon Musk, who has disqualifying ties to the CCP. Musk's Tesla operating in China is subject to Chinese law requiring it to ""assist or cooperate"" with the Chinese Government's ""intelligence work"". Tesla Shanghai produces 50% of Tesla's global auto output.  On January 17, 2025, the unanimous SCOTUS identified that a national security threat existed with ByteDance Ltd. See: *TikTok Inc. v. Garland*, 604 U.S. 3 (2025):  >ByteDance Ltd. is subject to Chinese laws that require it to “assist or cooperate” with the Chinese Government’s “intelligence work” and to ensure that the Chinese Government has “the power to access and control private data” the company holds. H. R. Rep. No. 118–417, p. 4 (2024) (H. R. Rep.); see 2 App. 673–676.  Musk's connection to the CCP, (like ByteDance's connection) makes Musk a national security threat to the United States. As a condition of Musk doing business in China, Musk must “assist or cooperate” with the Chinese Government’s “intelligence work”.  Musk is doing the bidding of Beijing on issues such as TikTok, Taiwan, H-1B visas, and tariffs. Now Musk's attempting to rob the U.S. Treasury. Respected officials like [Senator Ron Wyden](https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-demands-answers-following-report-of-musk-personnel-seeking-access-to-highly-sensitive-us-treasury-payments-system) (D-Ore, Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee), [Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro](https://delauro.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/delauro-letter-congressional-leadership-musk-chaos-government-funding) (Democrat-CT-03, Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee), and [retired military](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/opinion/elon-musk-china-classified-secrets-national-security-russia-doge.html) service members are sounding the alarm."

This is what we know so far about Musk's hostile takeover of the U.S. government and its payment system.  The new team at OPM includes software engineers and Brian Bjelde, who joined Musk's SpaceX venture in 2003 as an avionics engineer before rising to become the company's vice president of human resources. Bjelde's role at OPM is that of a senior adviser. Another senior adviser is Riccardo Biasini, a former engineer at Tesla and most recently a director at The Boring Company, Musk's tunnel-building operation in Las Vegas.  Amanda Scales, also a former Musk employee, is now OPM's so-called chief of staff. [New OPM hires also include a 21-year-old and a 2024 high school graduate](https://fortune.com/2025/01/29/top-hires-donald-trump-office-of-personnel-management-high-school-graduate-gen-z-elon-musk/). The 21-year-old will serve as a senior advisor to Scott Kupor (Trump/Musk pick for the director of OPM), and the newly graduated high schooler will directly report to Amanda Scales. [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lackeys-office-personnel-management-opm-neuralink-x-boring-stalin/), reporting on the shake-up did not name the two individuals out of sensitivity to their ages.  All (with the exception of OPM Director Scott Kupor) appear to be Musk's employees or hired and supervised by Musk's employees.  New OPM Director Scott Kupor was a managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm. Scott Kupor, [Marc Andreessen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RpPTRcz1no) and Elon Musk are longtime associates. In keeping with trend, Trump rubber-stamped Musk's pick of Scott Kupor as Director of OPM."

Millions of pointless government jobs that should be eliminated or replaced with AI and trillions in insolvent entitlement programs.   I am also against Trumps wasteful spending for what it’s worth.   I will give up all my entitlements if it means we can help the planet and future generations. We can’t all just keep taking.

When they launched the coin, only 20% of the coins are in circulation for trading, inflating the value as people are only trading a small subset of the total ICO (more demand then supply). Once the price is pumped enough, the insiders start dumping (rug pull). As soon as they start mass selling, the price collapses (More supply then Demand).  Blub below is from this article: [https://bizbeat.nus.edu.sg/thought-leadership/article/trump-meme-coin-promoting-or-destabilising-the-cryptocurrency-space/](https://bizbeat.nus.edu.sg/thought-leadership/article/trump-meme-coin-promoting-or-destabilising-the-cryptocurrency-space/)  # Exploitative nature of $Trump  The Trump Coin is the latest meme coin that has entered the fray, and is facing criticism for its speculative nature, lack of clear utility, and potentially exploiting political fervor for profit. The value of Trump Coin is also highly volatile, driven by market sentiment and not by economic fundamentals. Slightly more than a week after its launch, $Trump fell to $25.73 per coin, a drop of around 65% from its high.  Even though crypto finance started as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance, more recent crypto ventures pivoted towards centralized governance. Trump’s ventures control 80 percent of the $Trump supply, yielding significant influence over the price.  One significant concern is the potential for $Trump to serve as a conduit for funneling money to Trump’s personal interests or political campaigns, bypassing traditional transparency and accountability mechanisms. Such cryptocurrency could obscure the sources and uses of funds, enabling corruption or unethical financial practices. Anonymous or pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies amplifies these risks, raising questions about the oversight and regulation of politically themed digital assets.  President Trump’s involvement in crypto also presents ethical and national security risks. His financial stake could influence regulatory decisions, disincentivizing him from favoring restrictions that might negatively affect the value of his tokens. Concerns about foreign agents anonymously using the tokens to gain leverage over Trump’s policies are also valid.  Prominent investor Mark Cuban echoed these sentiments, while expressing strong skepticism about the meme coin investments. “This is not crypto any more than Madoff was just buying and selling shares of stock,” said Cuban, while celebrity Bill Maher, compared the meme coin to Bernie Madoff selling Pokémon cards."

I have some oceanfront property in Kansas I can sell you for a good price 😂  And here you are handwringing again over unconfirmed fraud while real corruption is occurring out in the open.

Non-reversible transactions, as you mentioned? I'm from a 3rd world country and even here that's hardly a problem since checks went the way of the dodo. It's actually a huge pain to have them not be reversible, hence us living in the ""golden age of scams"".  The whole ""our coin is deflationary"" schtick that's sold as a feature is actually a bug, and a pretty darn bad one at that. You don't want deflationary money lest your economy grinds to a halt. It's not even good enough to buy drugs since transactions are kept on a public ledger that law enforcement might track.  Honest-to-goodness, I'm not licensed to give financial advice outside my own country, but please be wary of crypto and understand how it's priced. It is not a substitute for central bank money, it's pricing is veeery bubble-prone and the minutr faith is lost in it it crashes into nothing. The reason thia hasn't happened to bitcoin yet has more to do with who is propping it up (Russia and N. Korea) than with any merits to the tech itself."

My rentals COULD be used as a family homes, but money doesn't hold value for shit, so houses are used as a crutch to beat inflation, causing housing to sky rocket in price.

We work far less for a far higher standard of living than people even a hundred years ago, let alone most of human history. A hundred years ago we didn't have a forty hour work week. We had labor organizers being killed by private security forces (like the Pinkertons). Since then, real wages have mostly gone up. We spend much less of our time working and we enjoy a much higher standard of living. You're blinded by nostalgia and rose tinted glasses. We have societal problems today, sure, but it's just nonsense to say we were better off a hundred years ago.   >This is resulting from removing value from money in 1971.   Learn your history. The actual gold standard ended long before 1971. The Bretton Woods system was a gold exchange standard, which is fundamentally quite different.   >a system that benefits EVERYONE when everyone produces, not just benefits the ones closest to the money printer wit the most amount of assets   Money is created when it is lent and borrowed. So literally anyone that borrows money for any purpose benefits from the system. It's not just the richest people and banks. Credit creation is what modern economics is built on, and has been since the Italian bankers formalized it 500 years ago. It's what allows ordinary people to get their hands on (credit) money when all the ""hard"" money is sitting in Scrooge's vault somewhere.   Take the history of our own country as an instructive example. Thanks to the increasingly oppressive policies of the UK at that time, there was a lack of specie in the colonies. So they developed paper credit monies issued by states. Amda Smith even wrote about it as a novel experiment in creating legal tender out of paper. Eventually, the money issue became so divisive that we rebelled over it. I don't think it's an over-exaggeration to say create our need to create our own money was one of the key inciting factors for the Revolution."

As I explained, modern credit money is created when loans are made, and destroyed when they are paid back. That means the broad money supply is NOT determined by some single entity or Central authority, it is a function of the lending and borrowing decisions of countless individuals, firms, banks and other institutions.   >I'd rather life get easier, not harder.   It IS getting easier. Productivity is rising, real wages are rising. You're implying that things are getting worse for people but that just doesn't match reality. And anybody who really looks objectively at things over the long term can easily see that this is the case. A working class American today, even someone living paycheck to paycheck, has a far higher real standard of living than many middle class people 100 years ago.    The problem is, you are looking at things from such a narrow perspective. It's totally understandable, from an individual perspective, that you would want the things you own to increase in value without any work on your part. But is that really a good model for society as a whole? Does it really make sense that people should be rewarded for doing nothing? No.   Who truly benefits from the modern credit creation system? The people who make profitable loans and the people who turn a profit by borrowing money. In other words, the people actually doing things; allocating resources and creating value. People who simply hold on to their money, who don't do anything productive with it, who don't spend it or invest it or use it to create value in some other way, lose out as their money loses value over time. AND THATS A GOOD THING. We WANT to reward the people who are doing real work and creating real value, NOT the people who are just squatting on some assets hoping they appreciate or earning economic rents in some other way despite providing no real value to society. That's why people who actually create value deal in credit, and only speculators and rent seekers are crypto stans."

As I described, lending decisions in our modern system are made by a huge and diverse range of institutions, many of them competing directly against each other. There isn't one central bureaucracy that determines all the loans that get made, that would be a ridiculous distortion of reality.   >The money in your bank is not technically yours   Demonstrably false. Credit money is an asset. The money in my bank is a promise by my bank to pay me the equivalent in cash or reserves. And the system is set up in a very robust manner to make sure the banks can always make good on that promise. Meanwhile, crypto entities like exchanges offer far far fewer protections. You're an unsecured creditor with no legal recourse if you lose your money, or if the institution goes down, in contrast with traditional banks, where your money is protected even if the entire bank fails. Even if you self-custody your crypto, there is still no legal protection against theft or fraud. So cryptic holders are actually much more vulnerable than those who use ordinary credit money.   >I'm very familiar with how loans work   Just saying this doesn't make it true.

If you are going to have an opinion about this, at least read 1 book on bitcoin. Your thought process is very off base  If you're lucky, you will see it and it will help you like it helped me and my family.

Even the last person to adopt bitcoin will see prices fall towards the margin cost of production forever.  Take more than 1 hour to make you decision. Read a few books. You owe it to yourself. We all do.  Look to history, EVERY single centralized money has been captured in society. The Fed was designed to be decentralized and quickly was muscled into being centralized again..  Again, I was a skeptic until about 25-30 hours in. Now I'm \~1500 hours in. I could link every piece of corruption in the world to the fact that money is created out of thin air by a central authority. Try me. Seriously.   Forever wars, $600k speeches to congress, elite families running the world. All made possible by having the authority to create money and price money for society.  Imagine how long a war would last if a government had to tax or budget for it's funding. You pay higher prices directly due to the creation of money for war. It's where we spend most the US budget actually.  Imagine all billionaires being forced to create the value to support their worth and not just standing/positioning close to the money printer.

And we actually talk a lot about this in the Bitcoin community because people always like to say people were ""lucky"" if they bought early and held;  Early Bitcoin adopters from VERY early on had zero clue Bitcoin was going to be worth anything. And if they held that long, which 99.999% did not, it was through multiple 85% draw downs. You basically had to be extremely smart, or be ok with massive risk, uncertainty, and losses.  Basically, no one in the right mind held from $1 to $1,000 without selling unless they lost their keys. People do not have the psychological capacity for that. When it comes to assets that are new and misunderstood, people sell at 50%, 100%, 2x, 3,x, maybe 10x if they are really strong minded and extremely lucky  The majority of the big holders now bought during or after the 2017 bullrun (and on chain analysis will show this to you if you care to look) when resources were readily available to articulate why bitcoin would continue rising in price.  The notion that early adopters hold all these coins exposes a lack of market understanding and psychology. Research hodl waves.  Have a good one man"

If a lot of people buy it, the value goes up. If a lot of people sell it, the value goes down.  In a stock market, when a company is doing well, lots of people want that stock, so the price goes up. If the CEO of that company starts doing nazi salutes and people dislike that, they sell the stock and it's value drops.  But with Crypto, there is no company or stock. It's literally just a digitized blockchain that requires mining to create coins. I don't really understand how that works though but it makes a crypto coin. People buy these  coins and hope that others do too to inflate the value of that coin. Since it's not tied to a company or the economy, it's incredibly volatile and almost impossible to predict if it will gain or lose money.  Meme coins are crypto coins that are usually created as a joke or scam. They don't have much of a blockchain and are usually sold by a celebrity to get people to buy in and artificially inflate the price of that coin. Then the person running the coin does a rug pull. This is where the creator sells all of their coins after everyone has invested and no longer does any work to add to the blockchain and leaves with all the money.  So crypto is incredibly susceptible to scams. Also, while encryption can make crypto wallets harder to hack, it's not impossible.  Trump did this with his meme coin before his inauguration, he and his friends invested heavily into it, and then he used his position as president to announce it to his American fan base. As more and more people bought it, the price inflated. As soon as the price hit whatever Trump's goal was, he and his friends sold all of their coins taking all of the invested money. Because so many coins were now available, the price dropped and people were left with a bunch of worthless coins, because the creator has abandoned the coin and is no longer adding to the blockchain. This is known as being left ""holding the bag"". About 810,000 people lost about 12 billion dollars when he did this.  Also, crypto buying and selling doesn't go through banks. So if you send or receive a payment, there is no record of it, except on the block chain itself or a ledger. So, say you wanted to take a bribe from a hostile government. You invent a meme coin and then announce that coin. The hostile government then buys enough of that meme coin to inflate the value of the coin to the correct bribe amount. You then sell all of your shares of the meme coin and walk away with all of the bribe money. The hostile government is left holding the bag but doesn't care because it wasn't an investment, it was just a transfer of funds. And no one can prove anything because you control the ledger.  Now, why is all of this bad? Because he wants to put our tax money into crypto coins. Now, he can invest his personal money into a coin, then use the treasury money to buy a lot more to artificially inflate that coin price , then yank out his money and leave America holding the bag.  If my understanding of crypto is off, someone more knowledgeable in crypto can correct me. =D"

But Sovereign wealth funds are for countries that bring in more money than they spend.  Countries like Norway, Abu Dhabi or Saudi Arabia, usually because the governments sell a great deal of natural resources like Oil and bring in more money than they spend to run their governments.  But our government in the US runs on a deficit, and we have a substantial amount of debt, so we are essentially borrowing money to invest it into crypto.  So we not only have to make a return, those returns need to outpace the cost of the debt we take on to invest.    It’s basically like buying crypto on a credit card.

This move positions the United States as one of the largest holders of bitcoin globally. ￼  Historically, such significant governmental endorsements of bitcoin have led to increased market confidence and price appreciation. For instance, El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 and has continued to bolster its reserves, recently surpassing 6,000 bitcoins.  While this strategy has attracted global attention, it has also faced challenges, including volatility and scrutiny from international financial institutions.  ￼  The immediate impact of the U.S. establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has been an uptick in bitcoin’s price, reflecting heightened investor confidence. However, the long-term effects will depend on the government’s management of these assets and the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in the financial system. As more countries consider integrating bitcoin into their reserves, the cryptocurrency’s value could experience increased stability and growth.  ￼ ￼ ￼"

Whether or not congress chooses to challenge his illegal power grabs is up to them. The current issue is that the framers of the constitution never forsaw the executive having political control (for whatever reason) over a majory of the members of congress (house and senate) or the Supreme Court.

Right now, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) is just consolidating Bitcoin the government already owns from criminal seizures. Step one is literally cleaning up the mess: getting all that BTC accounted for, secured, and under one roof. Think of it like finding money in your couch cushions before you even consider opening your wallet.  First, audit and centralize existing holdings.  Second, use **budget-neutral** moves (like the Exchange Stabilization Fund) to accumulate more without new costs.  Third, build momentum and eventually lock it all in through bipartisan legislation so it can’t just get rug-pulled by the next administration.  The game theory here is wild because if the U.S. doesn’t move fast, you better believe China, Russia, and the Gulf states will. And once that race kicks off, good luck catching up.  So no, we’re not at the stage where Congress is allocating billions to buy Bitcoin with tax dollars. But the setup is in motion. First they stop selling seized coins. Then they hoard. Then they accumulate. Gradually… then suddenly."

What a bunch of ignorant nonsense.  Nobody fails to see it. The volatility is there and it's fine. Look at a volatility chart and you'll see how it's dropping year over year.  Think for more than 5 seconds and you'll realize there is no other way for an asset to become monetized on a global scale within 30 years without huge volatility - it can't go up in a straight line because some people get too hyped when they see it go up and cause price bubbles, and other people like you are occasionally too sceptical and cause panic sells. This is just normal market behavior. If you paid any attention the normal stock market works the same way and occasional market crashes are a recurring and normal occurrence. It's just less volatile because its harder to move the price by 1% at its current market cap. When Bitcoin is done growing it'll be more stable than gold and the stock market.  Also I see you haven't even bothered to read the article I sent because the subject of volatility is treated there as well.  I wouldn't be surprised if you don't bother with reading in general."

It's always been a bubble like any communication technology since probably at least the telegraph although that predates modern stock exchanges.

I won't spend my day looking up more arguments for you especially since it doesn't seem you're actually interested in exploring new ideas.  Regarding your worry: humanity will forever consume exponentially more electricity going forward, forever. Until we become a class 2 civilization or we die trying. Energy consumption is inherently something good and drives progress. More consumption means more investments in better and more efficient production, leading to more consumption. You of all people should know that, since you've already been part of multiple energy hungry mass scaling revolutions which worked exactly the same way.  Energy consumption anchors Bitcoin to reality. It's great that we have something digital that can't be produced out of thin air and can't be attacked by entities that can't compete with its security scaling through consumption.

It was a recipe for disaster.  The U.S., on the other hand, has proven its resilience over and over throughout history. The issues you’re feeling right now like lower purchasing power, lack of jobs, or housing prices being through the roof-are real. But Europeans have been feeling this for years, ever since the covid policies.  All the government stimulus in 2020 isn’t free; it has to be “paid up” somehow. You can’t print trillions of dollars without breaking something. To fix this, you need to tighten liquidity, which is what central banks have been doing. This will lead to more fiscal responsibility, less cash misallocation, less risky investment-some of this is already happening. Depending on how resilient the economy is, this could lead to a recession (for many, it already has), but eventually, it will lead to a productivity boost-more work, more innovation, and that’s what will make the economy healthier in the long run.  The U.S. faces economic problems, but they don’t have 60 different ethnicities to keep in check. There aren’t barbarians invading the country, and U.S. doesn't have a weak military. Whether people like it or not, the U.S. is still a global power, and it will probably be like that for a while.  Betting against the U.S. isn't a safe bet."

This is the key architecture for the business strategy behind MicroStrategy and is currently being adopted by other non-US companies that hold BTC as a backing for their bond issuance. There are many non-taxpayer funds that are available for use to buy and hold Bitcoin.  The U.S. government has multiple non-taxpayer-funded options to accumulate Bitcoin, similar to strategies used by private firms like MicroStrategy:  Forfeited Bitcoin Holdings: The U.S. regularly seizes Bitcoin from criminal cases (e.g., Silk Road). Instead of auctioning it, the government could retain and expand its holdings.  https://jlopp.github.io/us-marshals-bitcoin-auctions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com  Bitcoin-Backed Bonds: Like MicroStrategy’s bond strategy, the government could issue debt collateralized by its Bitcoin reserves, raising funds to acquire more BTC without taxpayer reliance.  https://www.strategy.com/press/microstrategy-completes-3-billion-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes-due-2029-at-0-coupon-and-55-conversion-premium_11-21-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com  Federal Reserve’s Self-Funding Model: The Fed operates independently of Congress, funding itself through securities and service fees. This could facilitate Bitcoin-related initiatives without taxpayer impact.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve?utm_source=chatgpt.com  Existing Fed Loan Programs: Programs like the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) show how the Fed can provide funding against collateral. A similar mechanism could be applied to Bitcoin.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_Asset-Backed_Securities_Loan_Facility?utm_source=chatgpt.com   These methods provide a viable path for U.S. Bitcoin accumulation without new taxes, aligning with successful private-sector strategies."

So, your statement is true, but not for the reasons you think. And the problem boils down to the [Tether scam](https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin).   The entire crypto market is one huge pump and dump. It’s the biggest pyramid scheme mankind ever created. Tether is supposed to have $1 USD to back each and every Tether coin, but it very likely  doesn’t. More Tether can (and has been) created out of nothing to pump Bitcoin. Which means that Bitcoin is unbelievably overvalued. Bitcoin is the foundation of crypto. If Bitcoin collapses, so do all other coins. It’s a house of cards.   Ask yourself this fundamental question if you don’t believe me… Why does Bitcoin act like a stock if it’s just a currency? Why does Bitcoin’s value go up for seemingly no reason?   True currencies don’t act like stocks. Currencies are just denominational contracts. They aren’t an investment. A dollar doesn’t become more valuable if you hold onto it. Sure, you can gain some small interest on it if you loan it to your bank. But your earned interest will be nothing like the gains that Bitcoin is showing. That’s because Bitcoin / crypto isn’t a currency. It’s a pump and dump. This move by Trump is a plan to totally rob the working class blind. People will be left with nothing."

I could see GDP dropping like a rock.    Employers are already cancelling projects based on the tariffs already in place.  Markets are scared, which leads to decreased consumer spending.  70% of our economy is based on consumer spending; you fuck with that and a recession will happen immediately.    We have barely felt any pain from the upcoming recession or tariff impacts and the market has already had a mini crash.  Trump/Elon said they would lay off 2/3 of the 3 million government workers. If we continue this course, it’s going to get really bad.    To say it won’t get any worse than this, I’m assuming you’re not paying attention to the geopolitical implications of this administration, the national debt or economic indicators.    Just pretending that everything will be ok because Trump/Elon are in charge?  Or because you NEED Bitcoin to do well?    Take a step back.  All smart investors do.  Don’t look at things with emotion.  Don’t look at things through the lens of a Dem or Republican.

The way high interest rates ""fight"" inflation is by making companies turn to layoffs when their short cash, which they almost always are.   That triggers a recession so we all blow through our savings, take pay cuts, and work twice as hard to keep our jobs.  That's supposed to reduce demand while increasing productivity, because you are literally working harder for less.   And that's where  you get your ""lower inflation"".  It's bullshit. It doesn't work because the 1% just buy up our assets and their competitors and jack up prices, creating a perpetual inflationary spiral.   The way we got out of it last time (the 70s) was Chinese slave labor brought down prices. But Chinese wages are going up and birthrates are going down. Meanwhile we're about as productive as is humanly possible without turning to slavery."

Absolutely NO reason why they should be funded by taxpayer dollars.   Charity belongs in the realm of churches and billionaires, and not a role of government.   Why?  Too easy for freeloaders and grifters to piggyback on to these government entities and use them for personal enrichment, political motives, and for many other causes far more sinister.   Who do you think is funding all those HAMAS riots, ""summer of love"", Antifa, George Floyd riots, etc?   It's our taxpayer dollars taken by far left political entities.    They are very open about it too.   You see all these leftist Democrats chanting now ""we have to FIGHT!""   using every 4 letter word in the book, and inciting violence.  We the honest, good people of America deserve better.    There is a 90% silent majority, moderate left and moderate right, that has tolerated this nonsense in the past, but no more.  Easy solution:   defund it all, and if these radical far left crazies truly have the support of the people, they can go out and fundraise in the mainstream the old fashioned way.   Absolutely no reason why America's taxpayer dollars or deficit spending should go towards these extremist movements.  Just common sense, just like I would not support taxpayer money going to the far Right, to fire bomb abortion centers and incite violence against any people who are non-believers in Christianity, for example.  Government needs to do only the tasks that are essential, and no more.   Social programs are not the role of the government, because they can be manipulated so easily into something nefarious.   Similar for Climate Change.   Whether you believe in climate change or not, having governments use this as a vehicle for starting programs and initiatives is very dangerous.   Look at all the damage done by Biden Administration in 2021 with the ""Deficit Reduction Act"" which wasted so much money on absolutely nothing of value.    Now all the money is gone, no change to any climate issue, and all we have left are the receipts for the trillions of dollars of new debt that we will be paying into oblivion.     But that was never the point to do anything, because these climate change politicians never had any intention to actually change anything.   It is all about creating a narrative, a smoke screen to get people behind them to spread political propaganda, and nothing more.   Again, all these kind of things are best left to the private sector.    Companies will innovate and markets will change rapidly based on true needs and value provided.  The fact that the Left has attacked Tesla and Elon Musk for simply stating the obvious truth shows you everything you need to know.   Elon Musk has arguably done more to help the climate on Earth more than any other human being in existence.   If you hear him talk, he will say that we have to study and take great care of our planet.    Yet when he shows all the fraud and overspending of the government, the mask comes off these crazy Leftists, and they show their true nature.     It was NEVER about true climate change for these people.   This is truly diabolical and pure EVIL.  Think about it."

Whenever I hear someone say ""convicted felon"", that is a dog whistle for TDS.   Convicted of what exactly?   I watched the cases, and I read a lot of commentary on them.   All four cases they brought against Trump were desperately scraped together.   New York literally passed a law simply to then be able to prosecute Trump, and even then, their arguments objectively were simply laughable.  And let's not forget the ""special prosecutor"" looking into Joe Biden came to the conclusion that yes, Biden did a lot of illegal things with classified documents, but he was too old and senile to defend himself in court, so we are not going to prosecute him.  Actually look seriously at what you are saying.   Do you even understand how absurd you sound?  Clearly the majority of Americans saw the same thing I am saying, which is why they actively VOTED for Trump in 2024, and why he is now President.   Let that stick in your craw.  A DELUSION is believing a reality alone, when all others around you see it for what it is.

A few facts about this: USA and Denmarks and Greenland have an agreement about defence of Greenland. First signed in 1951 between USA and Denmark and confirmed in 2004 with also Greenland signing. The agreement allows US troops in Greenland and at its peak during the cold war there were 15.000 US troops in many air bases, naval bases and radar stations across greenland. However, after the cold war ended US started withdrawing and today there are just 200 US troops left in one air base. But if the terrirorry is again being center of geopolitical tension there is absolutely nothing preventing US from negotiating re-opening of many of its bases and sending more military. Meanwhile Denmark contributes with some (mostly naval) presence and generally keeps the Greenland population firmly on the ""right side"" by very heavy subsidies to the Greenland population. Should US choose to send troops back and re open bases, a place to start could be the abandoned Camp Century where they earlier had a project involving nuclear defence. Upon its abandonment by the US army only the reaction chamber of the nuclear generator was taken while a large amount of biological and radioactive waste was left as it was hoped time would encapsulate it by snow and ice. However, with global warming the waste is now re surfacing and it is a great idea to have US back to clean this up before it pollutes the very fragile arctic ecosystems. Hope this clean up is part of the calculations."

It rose .3% in April so far and 3.4% YoY, so an increase.   You keep whining about liberals when you’re not talking to one, claiming things about what they say when that isn’t what we’re talking about, and talking about crying when a *child* would be the one ignoring the facts and claiming things that didn’t happen and is easily disproven.   You’re a joke, dude.  Edit: And the unemployment numbers are before the mass firings of the Fed are taken into account. April is gonna be juicy. 👀  Then May can factor in all the jobs lost due to tariffs! Last month went down because 30k went unemployed. And DOGE just axed like 250k fed jobs. 😂"

So no, no recovering or new heights. It *almost* hit that high in early Feb then tanked. Trump has presided over 8/10 largest drops in history. And not uncertainty, every major dip was precipitated the day before by Trump and tariffs.   Faded gas stickers about gas prices? You mean something the President doesn’t control? I wasn’t even born in the 1970’s but that demonstrates the US has no control. Not sure why you think stickers at a pump mean anything.   You talk about government bloat but DOGE hasn’t really gotten rid of anything. Every time Elon cites a number it’s disproven, and with dumb shit likes Trump’s $100M military parade it all evaporates. And given it happened in the last month you literally have no data to corroborate “bloat” beyond what they told you is bloat.  So let’s see, you’re blatantly wrong on one fact you keep harping on, and the rest are easily disproven generalizations.  Gotcha."

He's laid off thousands of veterans from their government jobs, destroyed government agencies, and is currently trying to shut down social security. He has implemented half-baked blanket tariffs against the whole world, which will cause job loses, a recession and cost Americans thousands of dollars each year in extra taxes while stealing hard earner money from Americans 401k and investment accounts.

Also by your logic the DOW surged after Biden was elected, and by significantly more. Strongest post-COVID rebound of any western country.  But you’re gonna tell me a DOW that went from 25k to 45k under Biden only did well because.. Trump? Look at a graph dude. Got to 43k pre-election but that final 2k is all thanks to Trump?

However you didn't deny any of the claims made, instead trying to deflect back into the point of a clearly biased post that is linked to a VERY bias newsletter. Fine.   MSN and the op make a bold claim in rethinking their relationship, in truth the nations within the EU have already been trying to make China not only a strong trading partner but also systematically make their citizens be alright with the CCP, they actively deny any propaganda while doing little to combat it. It will cause a civil war within countries like Spain and Sweden to name a few, due to their aggressive dislike towards the ccp  Now for the current admin, Donald Trump has been seemingly flip-flop on his stance but no one also looks at the fact that he is taking calls from these countries. Deals are being made. Of course most newsletters would like you to believe that he is ""backing down"" while he is actively showing off each deal that is being made. This has been one of the most transparent administrations in recent history, the problem is a majority of people consume media through bias networks or even ones that aim to be factually wrong on purpose. The real truth of the matter is, we as a people never get the whole picture right away. Last month, the main media would have you believe that Canada doesn't have any tariffs on us, now they say they do have tariffs but it's so they can compete. The only actual problem with this current admin is how much show-boating is being done, a majority of things being done are what over half of the country voted for, the tariffs where always in the plans and everyone screaming ""recession"" doesn't actually know what they are talking about because for the last 3 market crashes, economist failed to predict it.

Depends on what you think is radical. For the last 30 years + we’ve had presidents who basically fall in like with the state department, with very little actually changing from president to president. Having someone who doesnt fall in line is important and necessary.   It’s good imo that businesses can’t plan / need to react on these tariffs. Tariffs are a tax. We don’t want them to tax plan around it or up charge consumers. True uncertainty in the market will generally limit risky investments, but maybe that’s ok for the minute if the outcome ends up being a win for us.   Not sure what industry you’re in, but tariffs in some industries are **absolutely** needed. For example, accounting firms have stopped hiring college students because we’re outsourcing all the grunt work to India for like $4 an hour."

Have some respect nephew. Not only mildly disagreeing but disagreeing by orders of magnitude? Do you even know what that means?    Now, do you have a source for this claim?   ""Once Trump starts up a mobile crematorium to liquidate political enemies like Xi, then we can talk about who’s worse""   Are you talking about COVID? Not sure Xi had a targeted version but could be wrong.    ""For now, only absolute morons and apparently Europeans think they’re comparable.""  Let me guess, you are from the USA, and have rarely been overseas? Mexico and Canada don't count.   I am a part of neither of those groups that you so eloquently describe here, but Europeans always struck me as considered and well educated. Unlike non H1B Americans unfortunately, and those morons have been brainwashed into thinking that China is disappearing people right and left, all the while thinking that the Democracy Eagle swoops in with precision strikes that only hit terrorists.  China is bad if you aren't Han Chinese (sound familiar), but the US is definitley worse, especially now we aren't listening to judges or the rule of law anymore and are just sending innocent people to concentration camps.  I wonder if you think that USA never had CIA black sites, 100-1000's of coups in foreign countries (including removing one of the best leaders my country ever had), NAZI scientists in its space program (Operation Paper Clip), tests on minorities and soldiers without their consent, spending on Military and corruption while they have the worst life expectancy in the developed world and falling. They practice dragnet surveillance of the entire world including their citizens, have their own version of the social credit score (credit rating).  China has simply made pragmatic decisions that benefit the majority of its people, and have brought the most people from poverty into the middle class in History [link](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/04/01/lifting-800-million-people-out-of-poverty-new-report-looks-at-lessons-from-china-s-experience#:~:text=RELATED,and%20the%20Way%20Ahead%20(PDF)).   They have ONE Military base outside their territory, and some of the best educated people in the world. As a non american, with many many Chinese ppl in my country, I am certainly less scared of them doing something ill considered than I am of Americans."

With love and respect: First, human beings aren’t illegals. They can’t by definition be, unless we delegate them into a sub-species.  They can 100% have “illegal status” of arbitrary geography lines, or be “illegally present” in a country against these same lines. Encourage a reframe of the way we speak of humans. We’ll end up in a better spot as a country.  Secondly, remitting to another country is a fraction of the value produced inside the US. Encourage you to re-read my post and do some impartial research on the economic issue (which is what I’m arguing here).  Third, say you replaced these immigrant workers with US citizens. For one, companies in both blue and red states would never pay for this higher labor rate, you as a consumer would never pay for this higher labor rate, and therefore the service and agriculture economies would be a fraction of what they are today.  Hence, those replacement US citizen workers would not “recycle” those wages into the economy, because most of them would not take these jobs to begin with.  The problem is structural and tops down (govt -> companies -> US born labor -> immigrant labor). If you don’t believe me, please please read up on every single anti-immigrant labor movement since the founding of the US (Caribbean, Chinese, Irish, etc.)."

Anyway, I must confess I didn't watch the interview. I was simply expressing my curiosity and scepticism initially, and I'm glad to see that my preconceived notions were all proven to be correct, based on how you responded."

You didn't watch the video because you are too lazy to challenge your preconceived notions.    You make yourself look like an idiot.

I believe he is always like this -- meaning consistent in his message.  But obviously he can't explain his points in the 30 minutes allocated to his web show.

I WATCHED IT!!  IT SUCKED ASS!!!  SO BORING!!   REPETATIVE!!  I HAD IT 2X speed and STILL wanted to speed it up because of how slow and BORING it was.   Anyway, the thing that I got out of it was that he's really happy for himself that he's getting lots of people wanting to listen to him speak (paid speeches, but fuck capitalism, right? LOL), and that he's glad that people are actually starting to believe his BS about the the end of the US after -his words- ""DECADES"" of saying the same stuff"". The unawareness and cognitive dissonance is insane.   Most of it was just blabbing on about current events as if he's the ONLY PERSON who thinks its bad or crazy what Trump is doing.   Honestly, you could have pretty much any other old guy on there talking about Trump and it would be not too different.   2/10, good waste of time while I worked.   Did it challenge any of my ""preconceived notions""?   No, it solidified them and proved them to be correct.   Three hours and nothing of interest was said."

Actually using a falsehood would work better for whataboutism because it would spur the person you mean to distract into trying to correct the falsehood!
