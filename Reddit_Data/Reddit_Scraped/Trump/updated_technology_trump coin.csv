Below are potential signs to look out for of a possibly fraudulent cryptocurrency project:  1. **Pre-mined coin**: A large supply of these coins are allocated at the outset, removing the community’s opportunity to mine. 2. **Concentrated Ownership**: A significant portion of the coin supply is held by creators or insiders, which may lead to harmful or manipulative practices against other investors. 3. **Hype-driven Marketing**: Celebrity endorsements, aggressive campaigns, or influencer promotions might be used to create artificial excitement. Sometimes, fake buzz is generated through bot accounts. 4. **FOMO Strategies**: The fear of missing out is exploited in hopes investors to buy in during a price surge, believing it’s a lucrative opportunity. 5. **Insider Sell-offs**: Developers or insiders sell their holdings at peak prices, often causing the coin’s value to crash and leaving other investors with worthless tokens.  These tactics often resemble pump-and-dump schemes. Frequently marketed as “fun tokens” or “community projects,” such schemes can obscure their actual purpose and minimize liability.  **Disclaimer**: This content is for educational purposes only and does not provide legal or financial advice.

FDR tricked Wall Street, got the agency approved and appointed Joe Kennedy Senior to head it, Joe Senior was a major Wall Street dirty player who others there feared and he knew where all the literal bodies were buried, including those he buried himself.  He took control of the SEC and hired tough finance lawyers who then went after Wall Street, forcing people like JP Morgan Junior to give up absolute control of their banks (JP Morgan Jr was forced to take his bank public to avoid financial ruin).",technology

There's an old saying that I'm going to mess up, but it's something like, ""you only truly own what you can carry with you while running."" In the past, in terms of store of value, that was maybe a little bit of jewelry and cash. Because of crypto, now someone can store the key to a billion dollars in their mind, and walk right over a border with nothing to declare; that's power. Real estate can be seized, a safe can be cracked, a car can be towed, a yacht can sink, and cash can be forfeited, but unless someone literally beats the keys out of a bitcoin holder, nobody has the ability to show up and take their property while they're away.  While it's much easier to for say, one known wealthy person to be targeted over their bitcoin stash, first it has to be known that they even have it, and where this tech really shines, is with lesser amounts used by your everyday citizen. It's just not practical for a government to beat the keys out of everyone. It gives people true autonomy, for good or bad, over their property. Going back to the saying above, it may be the only thing they truly own. At a bank, your transaction is approved, and with crypto, it is confirmed. I'm not saying it has value to you, but it certainly does objectively have value in society at this point. It's no longer ""early."" Bitcoin alone is now #7 in assets ranked by market cap, just below Google and Amazon. Smart money doesn't fuck around with tulips",technology

Take that with a grain of salt cause I’m not 100% sure how the valuation works. But that’s my best guess.  Why would you ""clarify"" with a guess?

That piece that's on the lips of critics, art historians, the public at large, or pictured in the books and written into history... you _own_ that! The real, actual, singular thing! That's *yours!*  Externally, it gives you notability as the owner. You're the sole answer to the question ""Well, where is it now?"" It also can give you status or impress people. You're the only one who can show off and preen about having it. It can paint you as tasteful or cultured and introduce or elevate you in art-related circles.  Personally, it can be symbolic of your success and being able to have nice things. While you're admiring it aesthetically, you can also reflect on the qualities that let you come to own it.  If you're a particular fan of the artist, the style, the movement, or some other element, owning an original can bring a sense of awe and connection. You can hold the very material that was shaped by the very hand of the artist, or made in the actual place of renown, or that's been passed down from some time long ago. Having the real, singular thing that the world knows, but being able to experience its every nature in detail, the smell, feel, sheen, flaws or construction details, is especially evocative and significantly more real than any abstract description, image, or replica.  Personally, I collect old crap that's cheap but interesting-- /r/GrandmasPantry sorts of stuff, ephemera, institutional tchotchkes-- and this all is the appeal I get out of it. There's a thrill in rarity, in being the only kid on my block with some neat thing. There's that sense of connection, in being able to examine every little detail at my leisure with every sense, enough to transport me back in time or far away. And there's the sense of accomplishment. I expect there's similar for an art aficionado who's in it for more than investing. For me, it's not so much the ability to plunk down five or six figures on something-- because that's certainly not happening-- but it's the accomplishment of tracking something down and pulling it from some basement or house where it's been waiting for me.  And to bridge between my cheap ass collecting glorified garbage and people dropping stacks on art, if you're spending $80,000 or 80 mil on an artwork, you're probably economically situated in a way that it's at worst a ""hobby splurge"" amount of money.",technology

It's another example of how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer - if you can afford to lose the equivalent of an average person's annual salary in a risky scheme with no real effect, you can take that 10-1 or 50-1 chance. If you're living paycheck to paycheck, even if you could maybe turn $100 into $10,000, you simply don't have the $100 available to start and certainly not to lose.

For the TLDR - Martin Skhreli last year launched the coin DJT which apparently was supposed to be endorsed by Barron Trump. He says that they lied and didn’t hold up there end. So people just put some of the pieces together and evidence seemed to show that the wallet that made this Barron’s was indeed Barron. We know Barron is involved in crypto heavily too.   Personally, I feel it’s still possible that it WAS launched by Barron. But he would never admit to it due to the racist memes launched on that wallet. I believe it’s also likely Barron was involved in the scam last year but again will never admit or face punishment.   So yeah, it wasn’t just as cut and dry as ‘fake’. There was some proof/evidence.",technology

The large operators move money in a similar way regardless of the market.  Also regardless of the market, there is always a counter party, so someone always wins and someone always loses (or at least loses out on gains.) This is especially true if trading options. Look at the rise and fall of some mega stocks like tsla, these are hugely volatile, not based on actual company value. The thinner the instrument, the more easily it can be manipulated by a single party, like we frequently see with penny stocks. Many of these crypto coins are just like penny stocks. Then there is the foreign currency market, which is just conversion rate differences, but again price action mechanics are similar. The final interesting thing about these markets to me is how interrelated they are. One market goes down while the other market goes up. And in a very mirrored fashion. You can see it even down to a minute basis.",technology

That fixed price is in turn used to determine the value of its currency. For example, if the U.S. hypothetically set the price of gold at $500 an ounce, the value of the dollar would be 1/500th of an ounce of gold.  That's what I was thinking of. But apparently my knowledge is over 5 decades out of date, despite my being roughly half that age. Now the USA uses ""Fiat money"" where the value is backed by... people's faith in the value??? Point is, by definition, it is not measured by material goods such as gold, but by an immaterial measurement. So I learned something new and pretty damn relevant today. Thanks lol.",technology

I was on it for a few months straight before I had my money spread comfortably across several coins in various philosophies/algorithms. I still have never really lost much. At first making hasty trades id lose the spread so like $10. But then I figured out how to do limit buy/sell and that problem was fixed.  Staking is great. If you stake in a coin thats a good blue chip the interest you earn is ridiculous. More than you can earn at any bank. But again you can’t just log on and blindly do that or only listen to what others tell you. After a few months of studying it I think anyone with half a brain can start making money. Especially if you wait to buy at a dip. I hate Trumo but I’m all for crypto. I’m also not happy about the ETFs, I was at first bc the boom but it’s bringing more regulation. The apps are still having trouble dealing with the capital gains tax, which shouldn’t be charged until you convert to cash but it’s not happening that way for everyone. It’s happening on wallet transfers which is not a gain. It’s been a headache to do any active trading lately. I prefer staking anyways. And FUCK DOGE coin, love dogs, hate doge.",technology

Idk who did this and I fear it might be another right wing scammer, but I hope it was a left wing voter. We deserve to not be crushed along with them.

They you open up an account on an exchange using a fake ID, or a real ID that isn't yours, doesn't matter. There are plenty of exchanges around the world that are not subject to KYC.  You deposit your dirty bitcoin using your cold wallet addresses (possible even sending them through a mixer first, depending upon how paranoid you are) and use the account on the exchange to buy your shitcoin, er, memecoin - resulting in the pump that then allows you to sell your legitimately generated memecoin at what looks like a clean ROI.  This isn't rocket science.  I was using bitcoin back when you could still mine with a PC. I left before the lightning network because it was clear that bitcoin was never going to fulfill the defined purpose in the whitepaper, that mining was becoming centralized, and that mining was using an incredible amount of power that was contributing to global warming.

To distinguish the scams from the legit projects, you do marketing. I think the marketing is where they can ""get you"". if you promisee things that are inherently false (for example that this coin is endorsed by Barron Trump). However I'm sure you can phrase it in a way to be able to wiggle yourself out of any accountability, for example by advertising it with ""The official Barron Trump coin"" (the word official doesn't necessarily mean anything).  But in most crypto cases, if there was no actual hack, where they stole several m millions, these people don't suffer any consequences.

You sell all your coins and make money, cratering the price because there are more coins being sold than people want to buy 5. Everyone who hasn't sold at this point lost their money and will never get it back because the price will never go up because nobody is trying to use it as an investment or a currency 5.

All you risk is some bad pr *if* coffeezilla happens to make a youtube video about you.  Now why would you invest in a shitty memecoin that everyone knows will never do anything? Because if you get in at step 2, and get out before step 4, you make loads of money in a short amount of time. All you need to do is sell before the price drops, easy, right?

There is no mining on the Solana blockchain. Anyone can mint any number of tokens for nearly 0 cost.  Tokens have value based on how much Solana (the native token) is in a liquidity pool.  The popularity of the topic or meme represented by the token leads to speculative investment. Those buys put more Solana into the liquidity pool which causes the price to rise more.,technology

It was fun to watch people trade it before it imploded spectacularly in about 24 hrs lol. Interestingly, though, what caused it to fail wasn't that it was a ponzi, but that the underlying code in the smart contract had an exploit that allowed someone to drain the funds of the contract. In hindsight, that was probably a backdoor that the creator made themselves to rug pull everyone. Who knows though.

I get entirely where you’re coming from. But the fact remains, if the US economy crashed, or something happened in any way shape or form it could be devalued instantly. We assign it its arbitrary value. It’s propped up mainly by its trading which ties into the economy.   Crypto in the beginning was absolutely a scam, but the way it’s propped up is by its own economy. That’s why in the beginning it was a leap of faith and a scam because it had nothing to provide. No value or goods could be exchanged. This is entirely why BTC heads will tell you it’s such a big deal that more and more places incorporate it, because as it gets adopted it essentially acts as the USD and props itself up.   Again I won’t argue that a majority of crypto is a scam, but at the end of the day the only thing making it a scam is the adoption of them, or if they are just pump and dump schemes which is a net that you can’t even remotely try to throw over BTC itself. I do think BTC is a genuine currency at this point. That’s all I’ll argue on this topic so if I get downvoted fuck it. But I did enjoy this discussion.",technology

It’s not like a bunch of idiots all screwing each other. There are clear winners and losers, and that’s predetermined for almost everyone.   Like you said, it can be money laundering — someone invents a coin specifically so that they can receive a bribe or other illicit funds, and when they cash out, it was just a normal, legal crypto “investment.”   In the case of most meme coins, though, it’s just someone creating a coin with the intent to pump and dump/rug pull.

They buy the coins, probably though a network of randomized wallets. The market value of the coin increases, as he and his family unload their coins onto the market, causing the price to crash.  Trump makes money, companies or governments ""lose"" money. On paper it looks just like another meme coin or any other market trading, because the exchange isn't direct. Except even the largest meme coins are generally like $5-$20 million at most, this coin did around $2,000 million.  Certainly some of these were Trump fans or people who wanted to get into what would be a hot market. But Trump's entire 2024 campaign only raised about $390 million. So to think that his fans would pay nearly 5x for a meme coin then they gave to get him elected is fool hardy.  It's not like every cent goes to Trump, but Trump and his associates do appear to have made $800 million (twice the amount they raised campaigning). The lost value from their perspective is just he cost of laundering the money.  But I promise you many entities bought this with the goal of getting on Trump's good side hoping for more favorable conditions. When someone launches an meme coin weeks before becoming the most powerful man alive, the implications are easy for anyone to see.  This isn't the only conflict of interest Trump. Its very common for diplomats to stay Trump properties, which have insanely high rental rates which might cost hundreds of thousands per guest per week.

They could start fronting the politics of Democrats who actually wants to make the people happy, and they would win in a heartbeat.  I fear they are too business-oriented and driven by the money, while also holding on to their beloved forced progressive agenda, which to me seems to alienate 30%+ of voters who have left-leaning views but feel they can't resonate with the party politics.  Also in my opinion it was not a good idea to front themselves as the party of minorities, LGBTQ+ people, women and African Americans, and then leaving out the white boy and man.   Crazy thing is, had I said that last part there before November 24, I'd be barraged with comments calling me a racist, women-hating far-right degenerate. Like, even talking about your personal issues would get you smacked in the face with the privilege-argument while being asked how you dare talk about your issues when this or that group of people have it worse.  The Democratic Party essentially created two groups of people: The ones who are allowed to express even non-issues (whining) and still get sympathy, and another group who could be on the brink of suicide and they'd still get told to shut up.  This, again in my opinion, is what made it so damn easy for Trump and his goons to market themselves to these boys and men, essentially by thelling them the Democrats are the reason for all their troubles - Which of course they are not, but they're not helping with them either.",technology

If someone bribes you in BTC, it is untrackable as long as you don't do anything with the BTC. Converting the BTC into USD or buying stuff with it directly is relatively easy to track, especially if you are a public figure.  The way easier version is to create your own coin, since this way the people bribing you don't even have to pay you any money, it is basically untraceable. You create your own coin which is worth nothing and where you own 80% and sell 20% for cheap to the public. Then, someone who wants to bribe you, buys ton of the public coins, which increases the price by a lot. Since you own 80%, a very high % of that value increase benefits you, with BTC where you own a much smaller portion it's impossible to change the value that easily. Then you can legally sell parts of your 80% to random people since the value of the coin is so much higher now. This way you got bribed without ever getting any direct payment from the people who bribed you.",technology

Harris-Walz was most definitely not pushing out LGBT or other minority focused messaging when they were on their 3 month campaign trail. Was just as horrible as Trump when it came to immigration. Harris ducked every question she could about trans kids and their care. Every ad on TV looked like a Republicans from 2000-08. She spoke more about her own gun than trans kids or Palestine. It felt like the left coalition was something she was pretending wasn't apart of her base, while also taking them for granted so she could get the white boy/man vote.  You are repeating the very white grievance she handled so clumsily. Yeah she needed to be in *your* face about union guaranteed work or a tax on the wealthy for your cost of living stimulus. She needed white guys to feel like the left didn't leave them behind in lifting up other voices.  Trump just had to keep campaigning like he did for 4 years. No one saw Harris as a improvement to Biden's policy who did a hell of a lot for white men/boys. Biden was the first president to stand on a picket line, and yeah Harris needed to also.  They absolutely needed to angle for the labor left of millions of dissafected voters and instead tried to get 3 never Trumpers from Michigan to flip. It was colossally stupid. Especially because America is *still* desperate for a change candidate. Harris could have been a change candidate, instead she was the worst of Clinton and Biden.",technology

They made an app that takes a picture of your ballot and then warns you if you inadvertently spoiled it somehow by marking things incorrectly. To test their app, they took a *single* example ballot and then randomly generated images from that ballot, filled out with some errors so the app would have something to detect. That seems entirely reasonable given you can't get hundreds of real spoiled ballots to test with. It can't generate any arbitrary ballot, just ones based on the example ballot they already had.  They say the tool ""could be used to invalidate ballots in bulk"" but the script has nothing to do with the vote counting infrastructure. And if you can inject a script like this into the vote counting machines, then there are a million ways you could fuck with the count.
