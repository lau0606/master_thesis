We should be launching into the Bananna-Zone. Trump is talking about aggressively expanding his trade war to the EU,.. not to mention the saber rattling about taking Greenland and the Panama Canal.  It's not an exaggeration to consider that aggressive trade wars could shock the global supply chain as much as covid and force a deep recession. Even if it's ""temporary pain"" as Trump says, it could take 6-12 months to work itself out. Just in time for crypto-winter.  I really hope I'm wrong but tomorrow could be a bloodbath for Stocks. If so I expect it will be worse for BTC. And Alts could get decimated.  Anyone got any hopium?"

He created a bill called the Inflation Reduction Act which created trillions of dollars in new money creation. The bill did the exact opposite of what they labeled it.  The FED left the rates to low when asset prices were going crazy in 2021 and 2022 before they really started getting serious about inflation.  So by your logic Biden gets credit for lowering inflation which is the very same inflation he created.  Prices are still higher today and have not come down the only thing g that change was the rate at which the increase has slowed but prices are still increasing.

Hell the fed may have to raise rates.  Tariffs are inherently inflationary.  The Fed could be looking at inflation roaring back at 10%+ and need to try and crush it again by skyrocketing the fed funds rate.  When that happens both stocks and crypto will tank off like 2022 again.  The alternative is let inflation get out of control and the economy run off a cliff.  Bitcoin didn't start growing again until the fed stopped raising rates (mid 2023).

Until cryptocurrency, it was a solid investment. That doesn't make it trash. The reality is that fiat will always exist in some form, and cryptocurrency may not. Fiat currency has been around thousands of years. Cryptocurrency has not. So i wouldn't sink everything into one bag. The dollar is sinking right now for a huge orange ass reason. Most top investors suggest 10% of your assets in cryptocurrency due to volatility. Personally, I would stick with the advice of seasoned investors, over gut feelings, and reddit.    I also understand buying the dip. Sure, in a normal situation, i would be in line with you buying... however you and I don't know how low this will go. Why through in $1,000 for it to drop even 10% over the next week. That doesn't help you or your cost average. Wait and be patient.

So if you buy 1000 shares at $100 a share and now it crashes to $10 a share... that doesn't affect your position? Damn I guess I've been doing this wrong, and my 1386% return is an illusion, and I should be buying stocks as they crash and lose money...   If I bought a stock that continues to lose and go down in value, that fundamentally affects my positions in a massive way unless you're shorting stocks.   The math doesn't matter in your scenario. If you constantly put money into something that goes down, that drives your value and holdings down. Do you not understand that? There is a massive difference in buying the dip and a crashing market.    Do you realize analogies can fit multiple scenarios? Right?   Just because something was coined or created during a specific time or situation doesn't mean it applies now.   Just like you say it's for a single company... can't you say the same now about buying the dip? It's meant for when a stock dips, a singular entity, not every single one across markets.    I hope I'm wrong. I don't want to be right in this situation because I was making damn good money, and now I have pulled it all out. I'll wait. I'll be cautious.   Take a page from Buffet on this one. The dude is sitting on $190B  in cash. He's being patient. Why? It's smart. The entire purpose is to profit. Not lose."

I have been for over 25 years. Unless you have loads of cash and risk appetite you need to look at longer term investing.   I have been in BTC since 2017. At first I got the sweats when it dropped by 10% but I understood quickly that there is a macro trend here. The same is true for normal stocks.   I have bought stocks many times over the years at non-optimal time points. I have had stocks that dropped by 90% in 2000 during the dot com bubble. But I stuck with those stocks as they had the right fundamentals. I stuck with them during the 2008 crash too.   Unless you have the cash to be a day trader, you need to look beyond a few days, weeks or even months and think in cycles. That 10% drop now doesn’t mean anything if you understand what you are doing and sit out the bear market for an increase of 100% over the timeframe of a couple of years.   This is investment 101"

I also don't think time in investing can mean one has more knowledge and / or experience. You have more exposure, and you've stuck with it. That's great for you. However, I'm not in this to lose money. You have your strategies, and I have mine. I'm not going to buy as prices go crashing down. If you have 25 years of experience, you can't tell me that is actually logical. Wait to the stabilize, then buy, that's my point. Sure, wait for them to go way down and then buy, that's basic.   I clearly day trade. I have long term investments, sure. That's retirement security. I also like to day trade and take the risk to maximize profits.

The market crashed after Trump's new tariffs, causing ETH to drop over 20% to $2,300 and removing about $500 billion from the crypto market cap. BTC and ETH saw massive sell-offs, with the global digital assets market showing heavy losses. The panic led to massive liquidations, with the biggest order on Binance valued at $25.64 million. Trump's tariff threats have impacted the market, reversing the recent rally fueled by his pro-crypto stance.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

The only bulwark of policy he has is Project 2025, and he's following it head on.   As for the rest, he's a petty crook who will bill the govt for staying at Mar A Lago and keep gifts he receives as President. He has no idea of what he's doing or why.

All of my crypto is long term gains right now, I plan on selling almost everything this year just so I can start my portfolio with a clean slate. Crypto is my only income right now and I want to keep all of my gains as long term because the tax advantage is amazing.   If that was not the case then I probably would have sold much more in the past month above 105k and been making buys below 100k, I'd probably be doing a DCA now as the price drops.   Idk the fact that microstrategy has been continuing to make aggressive buys seems kinda bullish to me, don't think they'd be doing that if their analysts thought we were at the top. There are other indicators that say we've got more room to go as well. I also feel like BTC has gained a ton of respect and traction in the traditional finance world this cycle.

I really hope we are not entering a multi year bear market, but it wouldn't kill me if we do. I just think there is still potential for huge amounts of growth this cycle.

This cycle definitely does feel a bit different, but I'm more afraid that the difference is that we won't see as big of a dip for a buying opportunity. I don't want to sell everything around the current levels and then not have the opportunity to buy back in cheaper in a couple years."

Crypto has collapsed and mostly plateaued already.  At least the stable coins have.  The bubble has already bursted and right now is an even lower dip.  There are still little bull runs you can find on a DEX and Solana has paved the way for good things in terms of trading in the near future, but $1k is nothing in terms of buying an absurdly obvious dip.  I appreciate people like you, because without them/you, trading would be much more difficult and more competitive.  Naysayers are my best friends when it comes to investing.  There are always a million reasons to not invest.  This is a dip after a bubble burst.  Nothing makes me salivate more than that.  Here is the other thing.  Humans don’t go back on technology.  They just don’t.  They can’t.  They won’t.  There are resistors, but if you don’t get with it, you get left behind.  Nobody cares that you get left behind.  Over time, you will have to adopt it or be ostracized as it gets implemented more and more into society.  Some people don’t mind that.  The overwhelming majority of people do mind it.  It is how we have become the dominant species on the planet.  Cryptocurrency is not only tech, but it is currency connected to tech companies using tech as a faux means of company shares that inflate the value of a company, increase their cash flow, and opens their market of investors to the entire world.  That is brilliant.  It’s like cheating.  It isn’t going to go away.  Sure, you could invest in some meme coins and lose your ass because you aren’t paying attention to the liquidity or volume enough to know you can’t be confident you’ll get that swap or trade at the value you had a plan for.  Sure, you can lose your ass when a tech company fails that you liked and invested in because of the information they gave you to get you to buy, but at the end of the day, you have to think about what crypto actually means to the world, and which companies have roots that really can’t be undone at this point.  The companies that this system relies on as the infrastructure to propagate a technology we can’t go back from is where the action is at long term.  I day and swing trade/swap crypto.  I also have long holds in it.  I was there when BTC hit $20 then $100.  When ETH was a dollar.  When Poloniex was titties and the SEC has no idea wtf to do with any of it.  They still don’t, really.  Avoiding KYC is easy with DEXs.  Naysayers like you made me so much money that I don’t have to work anymore.  I don’t give a single shit about what anyone else thinks on here because all of you are my competitors, but for anyone who cares, I’m buying now.  It’s a dip after a bursted bubble plateau.  The market itself is protected by our inability as a species to rid ourselves of technological advancement, which crypto is.  It doesn’t get much easier than this.  For those of you that are scared or holding some bags right now, please just go ahead and sell.  I like the little thrill of the dip continuing after I buy, but what I like more is when I keep being right after that.  My bank is a big fan too.  There is no such thing as a “different scenario than the regular fluctuating charts,” and there never will be.  Look into fractal geometry instead of Euclidean.  The chart patterns self repeat, market fluctuations self repeat, volume self repeats, naysayers self repeat at this point, and then wish they had the stones to kick themselves in the balls when I’m right again, while I self repeat my same process and take my gains to the real estate market to play the exact same fucking game again."

Traditional finance also has audit processes to guardrail the movement of capital. Crypto does not, so if you get access to a crypto wallet all you need to do is transfer the money out and there’s no intermediary to audit and stop the process  Though… breaking encryption on crypto will also completely devalue it, so it’s sort of a hack that’s shooting oneself in the foot"

Free market economics will largely ensure that this is somewhat equally spread around the globe. Countries or states that ban mining will obviously lose out, and same for countries that are technologically averse; but by in large, Bitcoin is decentralized just like the internet and adheres to decentralized principles where no single entity controls it. And although the current internet landscape is moving towards being largely centralized due to a small number of large tech companies dominating key aspects like data storage and online services, meaning it is not fully or totally decentralized today; the underlying infrastructure of the internet remains decentralized at its core and very much started that way. Same with Bitcoin.  Basically, there will always be winners who rise to the top and take more than their fair share but as long as it is done democratically in a fair manner, then it is considered natural. Making changes to the Bitcoin protocol will always be very difficult, but also very democratic.   As for ownership, even if one entity owned all the Bitcoin, it would not change the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Of course this would be extremely rare to even happen but ownership =/= mining."

If you go to other countries with bad currencies, many people will not accept the country's native currency as payment. For instance, in Argentina, homes have been priced in US dollars for years. Argentinian pesos are backed by their government, but for years have been losing >50% of their value per year.  That is where bitcoin's power is. Bitcoin's rules can't be changed (without control of over 51% of the network*). There is a finite amount of it and no government can change how much of it is getting made.  As more and more people realize this, bitcoins value will continue to increase. I think this was shown in the dip yesterday with BTC barely being affected. Give it another 10 years, BTC will likely be used for expensive purchases and a way to save money outside of currency."

The measures also include adding PVH Corp. and Illumina Inc to an unreliable entity list.

I'm just brainstorming here - what happens if funds get sent off to one of those wallets and only the recipient can return it but doesn't because they aren't in an enforceable region legally, they remain anonymous, or it ends up being a mistyped dead wallet or something wild? Would the US Treasury track known-good wallet addresses in a repo or address book thing for sending payments or something? Surely none of the wallets they would want to use & store money in would be KYC'd on an exchange?  What mechanisms are available to reverse errors or reclaim money sent to a wallet that was unknown, the legal system and the recipient I'm guessing? Currently a centralized bank can get involved to assist, but on the blockchain you're at the mercy of the system, right? Just trying to play out scenarios in my head.

Blockchain not only makes altering data very difficult but also ensures that if an alteration were attempted, it would be immediately noticeable to the network. In a regular database, you rely on post hoc audits or real-time monitoring systems which might not catch tampering until after it has occurred.

The blockchain can’t audit what happens off chain. There is a saying, “garbage in, garbage out”. If the fraudster misreports off chain information onto the blockchain, you have no evidence to assess its authenticity - unless you have outside info. But if you have outside info, you could whistleblow anyway without a blockchain.  The public already has the right to scrutinize federal agencies, under the Freedom of Information Act. Just streamline that process and make it easier.  Blockchain adds value when you can fully audit a transaction without off chain information. So it works best for transactions fully native to the blockchain, aka crypto to crypto. But if you deal with transactions like work for govt contractors, you get to see jack squat on chain."

The entire centuries-old system of checks and balances has been torn apart.  2.  In the past weeks, politicians have been breaking hundreds of laws, with increasingly-blatant disregard for the US legal system with each passing day.  3.  The US federal government is allowing a foreign citizen to access the personal treasury data of every single US citizen in the country.  For all of the American patriotic pride that we've heard about for decades, US citizens are embarrassingly willing to allow all of their civil liberties be completely thrown under the bus.  People in this sub support cryptocurrency to ""break the chains"" of the financial systems of the establishment.  And yet they are welcoming a fascist dictatorship with open arms, which will be a hundred times worse.  Sitting at home complaining from a keyboard accomplishes Jack Shit.

Protests and lawsuits can only accomplish so much.  Break apart the economic engines that power the country, and maybe the oligarchs won't be quite so bold.  The clock is ticking."

Maybe you would want a _public_ ledger, but thats really a security concern more than anything else.   If its centralized, then you are just running something more like git than a blockchain.   You can achieve the same thing by simply having hashes the current ledger entry combined with the previous one. If you want to change the ledger, you would have to force a re-write of everything from that point forward. similar to when a blockchain gets reorged or 51% attacked.  Every reputable ERP & accounting software already does this. I'm sure the software used by the US government does as well.

This means destroying the Pilar of the nation. After the war of independence the US didn't have no money because they eliminated the taxes after all the war of independence was have been fought against a king that taxes the colonies. So the USA at the first years of the founding of the country didn't  have tax system and the Treasury was out of money. It could not conver the expensive of running a government and couldn't not even pay the army they where ready to revolve against the government for not paying them and they have to go get George Washington to go talk to the army so they don't revole into a civil war . Thats that part of the history of the USA. That most people don't know. Andrew Jackson was against the banks because he knew they goal was to control the government Treasury.  The battle of waterloop was a crucial moment when England lost their Treasury.  So  This event haves been repeated through history and the results have been a total economic collapse of the Countries and empires that have lost their Treasury. It takes them awhile to recover and some never recovered at all.

However, this is a great introduction to tokenized assets, basically stable coins denominated in dollars that are back by treasuires, a potential evolution of the dollar. However, pay close attention to the settlement layer (aka consensus protocols). Ensure all the players that the public doesn't see but pulls the strings does in fact, have a say in the consensus protocols. Don't just force it into being. Take time and give no one party to much control. Also, think through central bank digital currencies. How they can both be integrated. But it also usurped if there was too much centralized control. The treasury at positions within are at least somewhat controlled by a protocol of democracy. Most of the gold is in new york right now, but may not be forever.

January 2019 with 1.,1 million USD in double spend, and August 2020 where more than 4000 blocks were rewritten. The August 2020 attacks caused most exchanges to stop support for ETC.  * Bitcoin Gold (BTG) was 51% attacked in may 2018 and had a double spend 18 Million.  * Vertcoin had a successful double spend of $100,000 in December 2018 via 51% attack  * GRIN currently has a single miner controlling > 50% of the network since 2020, causing a loss in value of 99.58% and dropping from most crypto exchanges in 2021.    Going into why decentralizing the US Government's Ledger would be a bad idea:  1) There is no miner benefit to supporting this ledger. ETH/BTC have miner rewards that ensure there is enough compute to resist hostile attacked. Unless you want to also have the US government needlessly spend money rewarding people for protecting their ledger, there is no incentive for anyone to run a node to contribute to the stability of the network.  2) There is a much greater incentive to attack a blockchain that runs the entire US government, and therefore economy. This would cause an absolute havoc and potential destabilization of the US Government.   3) In comparison, to 51% Bitcoin, it would cost you a lot of money, and the final end result would be that bitcoin would be dead - and you would have lost a lot of money to do it. You would be much better off supporting bitcoin with that money than attacking it. Thus, there is no clear incentive for anyone to try an 51% attack a sufficiently large enough network that rewards miners.  4) based on current bitcoin hash rates & mining hardware cost, it would only take about $10 billion to execute a bitcoin 51% attack. There is no way that the US government could incentivize enough nodes to run it's network to protect it at even that level. Bitcoin is protected more so by the fact that there isn't a good incentive to spend $10B kill it than by the ability to do so. It would be rather trivial for a company like OpenAI to divert their compute to successfully attack BTC, and even more trivial for a rival state to do so. The incentive for killing the US Treasury blockchain would be the destabilization of its entire economy."

The only way to ensure the data can't be edited is because you will have to create a new record for any change to a previous block. You can also ensure that funds or documents and data are going to the right recipient and verify it without any possibility of cover-up. There's little downsides to having a public blockchain. Funds won't go missing. All the information is available for all to verify. You can decentralise the system so that it's not vulnerable to attacks.

Many will be despondent and some will cheer it on ... until they too become victims of something.  It may take 50+ years to undo the damage if this trajectory is left unchecked for a few more weeks.  Well past the end of my lifetime.  Some of you realize what is happening, but thanks to control over media and social media, you're unfortunately in the minority."

The whole department went to a non-violent situation and it gathered attention. I recorded my approach to them and when I got close, the visual feed on my video was scrambled almost like radiation, except it looked programmatically forced. I still have the video."

This is why you’re seeing so many posts and things from democrats saying “it’s going to be a long 4 years”……everyone is still in denial.  The reality is that 4 years is not how this is going to work from here on out.  The goal is to clearly to establish some form of dictatorship/autocracy with control over govt. finances, departments, etc. then when rioting starts, a militarily enforced power structure via martial law.  They have every single tool and all the support they need to accomplish this.  I think that’s a big thing people are glossing over.  Even if we have the most stout resistance, they already have it more or less in the cards.  It will take dramatic nationwide strikes to stop this and our organization as a nation isn’t anywhere near cohesive enough yet to pull that off.  I’m terrified."

The payment processing system used by every executive agency could automatically write descriptive logs of transactions to an existing public immutable decentralized ledger.

The only treasury usage of cryptocurrency in that case would be to buy a tiny amount of network tokens for to pay its ledger write fees.

Says 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, blanket tariffs on Mexico, but is he bluffing? Is he serious? Some people freak out, some down play it. 2 weeks into his presidency, he announces tariffs on china, predictably, Mexico, like he said he would, and then CANADA, for some reason? But the numbers are all over the place 25% on Canada (but not natural gas), 50% on Mexico I think? And a small 10% on china. So he is swinging wild at our literal closest allies (both in trade and physically), and then going soft on China despite previous promises? And when the press asks why he’s doing or for more specifics he just says, “tariffs are amazing, the most beautiful word in the English language.” Then the day of the deadline CALLS THEM ALL OFF, except for China, after completely destroying all accountability with our two closest allies. And now is talking about doing it on the EU! And nobody knows why. He hasn’t given us a clear sight into his reasoning, or even gave us a bullshit excuse based in plausible legitimacy.

He's trying to colonize Mars, this pushes pur whole aerospace industry forward and could potentially save the entire human race in the future.   He doesn't patent the inventions his employees invent and thereby allows the whole planet to benefit from the innovations his company pays for.   You have to be an absolute idiot to none of those things benefit anyone... the Mars one  may even benefit you one day if none of the others do.  His choices as a CEO provide utility and value to this country.  Debate me if you think I'm wrong."

They should be more clear about what the ""plan"" is.   If you're going to have a centralized traditional finance database, how can you securely hook that up to a decentralized ledger? The system overall must be decentralized for any utility to be gained. What's to stop them from posting mocked data to the ledger? Nothing. If the entire system is not on chain (finances included) then we've accomplished absolutely nothing and just introduced a more expensive system in addition to what we have.    How do you see data being posted to a ledger as legitimate if the only source of truth is private fed data? You can't just post stuff to a ledger and claim it's true when the backing data is private. Elon can make a transaction to this separate ledger saying anything, it's just a transaction that does not inherently hook up to the private data.   Unless I'm seriously missing something, that makes absolutely 0 sense."

That crypto and all that money and data in computers and databases in banks and assorted data centers and applications will be inaccessible. Anything relying on elector-magenetic storage is like hosed.   So pretty much everything commercial and that consumers own becomes a varying stage of useless with any sort of ""internet"" being wiped out completely, your bank account and stock holdings included.

How about we prevent that added cost and just allow the government to continue to control a centralized database that has never had any know incursions.

One giant table with all US treasury transactions would be absolutely idiotic, and I can think of three reasons.  \-------------------------------------  So my understanding is that, since its the blockchain, it has one record for each transaction of the US treasury.   First, how many columns are needed to add context to that data? Sure, you want to know who sent/received money and for how much. But what about why it was paid? Which department and sub-department received and sent payments? Which state received that money? Or which private company? What if a payment needs to be updated before it is sent out, but it was already added to the table? That's a lot of columns to be added to this new table.   Second, which columns are unique and which can be duplicated? This enormous table needs a 'primary key', which only exists once in the entire table, and it is often a column. What logic will be used to build that key? By definition, primary keys cannot be NULL or duplicated. And what other constraints are there to build out? What if someone types in the state of 'C A' instead of 'CA'? Will the table reject that record since 'C A' isn't the right abbreviation? Or allow that record in, but flag it for review?  Lastly, so let's say all these questions are answered and we have this 'big beatiful table, the best table' (*trump voice*). Let's call this the 'fact' table. You now need what are called 'dimension' tables. These make managing data far easier than one giant table with everything. For example, our fact table wouldn't say 'CA', it would say '05'. Then we'd have a dimension table that relates '05' to 'CA'. We would need dimension tables for basically every non-primary key column, like Department, State, Reason, Private Company, etc. Dimension tables make it much easier since you can answer data questions without having to query the enormous blockchain 'fact' table.  \-------------------------------  In summary, I think Elon is going to blow up the entire system, causing missed/incorrect payments and total chaos across multiple governmental departments and employees. He'll try to use 'blockchain' and other BS buzzwords, only to see how hard it is and repair what he just broke. And the whole time, he'll blame 'DEI' and 'wokeness'.  Here is a link that better explains the relationship between fact and dimension tables. This is from Stack Overflow, which means it's like a 5-second google that Elon absolutely won't do.

See what happened with Ethereum when they had a vulnerability. The majority decided to go a long with reversing the malicious transactions. Same would happen in this case. You have a choice as a node owner. You can split off and continue with the original chain or accept the malicious chain.  The original Ethereum chain including the malicious transaction still exists for instance and if ever shutdown should be preserved for posterity. But these strengths are only available in public open chains.

Money will have expiry dates, limitations for what it can be used (carbon footprint limitations; cap on beef, air miles, etc) and easy to be bIocked if you buy stuff which they've flagged. We will become sIaves from governments and big corporations. A little less for those who own BTC.  So, keep telling yourself that all of this is for nothing, but know that you're the minority.

President Obama, in 2014, used an executive order to create an office within the Executive Office of the President called United States Digital Services, whihc has been running since then (without Congressional approval) through the remainder of the Obama administration, the Trump 45 administration, and the Biden administration. This is perfectly legal, because the President has broad authority to structure the White House staff as he pleases.  By Executive Order this January, President Trump 47 declared that the United States Digital Service was renamed to be the United States DOGE Service. The executive order went on to direct all agency heads to take all necessary steps, in coordination with the USDS Administrator, to ensure USDS has full and prompt access to all agency records, software systems, and IT systems.  So, legally, DOGE represents the same general sort of authority that, say, the White House Chief of Staff has. If you ever watched The West Wing, for instance, you might recall that Leo McGarry, played by John Spencer, wielded a great deal of influence in the administration — even though, legally, the source of his authority was “I’m telling you what the President wants done,” as opposed to “I am ordering you to do this because I want it done.”  Of course, seldom did people go back and check with President Bartlett whether Leo was really speaking for him.  In other words, the source of authority of DOGE is “We have the President’s ear,” and “We’re telling you what the President wants done.”"

Omb's records are public. I don't know how you could prevent fraud anymore.

Guys like Thiel and Bill Ackman are notorious for using their influence to push positive narratives when it suits them, then pushing negative narratives when they are trying to buy in or already hold short positions. These are incredibly well connected individuals who know politicians, leaders in finance and every other industry, major investors, “competitors” who are really only trying to give off the image of competing so that they can collude behind the scenes… they have an incredible influence on markets. They’ve even been caught engaging in what essentially amounted to market fixing and insider trading in the past and had to pay hefty fines, but it’s usually worded a bit more favorably… just look at Ackman with Valiant Pharma as an example and it’s clear what goes on.  Now crypto has become a big enough sector to be worth the time for some of these firms, and the relatively lax regulation makes all this even easier.  Trump isn’t doing anything creative here, he’s just following the instructions of his handlers who are running their usual playbook, just now with a President in place who has zero qualms about following their lead so long as he also gets a cut. It would be interesting to know who some of the investors making 7 figure buys on $Trump were, while most of us were still trying to figure out if he’d been hacked."

You probably had a lot of people entering crypto who otherwise wouldn’t have had the time or interest. Couple that with the fact a lot of people would have had extra cash on hand anyway as they weren’t going out doing anything, and key sectors which employ a lot of high earners like tech were thriving (everyone seems to forget how skewed the negative impact was towards industries like hospitality, while others like tech surged), I think crypto would have benefitted even without the stimulus checks simply because for many it was a form of gambling/entertainment with high potential payout, during a period when they had all the time in the world to sit at home watching charts, and excess cash to burn. The stimulus checks probably played a larger role from a complete macroeconomic standpoint, but I think the crypto bull run was primarily driven by other factors, and stimulus checks were just the cherry on top.  We also shouldn’t forget that 2021 was likely always going to be the most aggressive alt season anyway, since it was right when crypto was hitting the perfect blend of increased adoption, while still having room to grow without the market being so oversaturated with new coins."

Imagine being able to send out updates and various other commands from inside this system, as well as the ability to leave behind some choice programs and backdoor commands. Imagine the system crashing and having the political influence to insist that it was bound to happen and you have a solution that only you can implement."

FOR THOSE OF YOU LOOKING TO TURN YOUR ANGER INTO ACTION, here's some advice from a high-level staffer for a Senator. Re-posting from a friend of mine:  There are two things that we should be doing all the time right now, and they're by far the most important things.  You should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.  1.	⁠The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have face-to-face time — if they have town halls, go to them. Go to their local offices. If you're in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the ""mobile offices"" that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson's website). When you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better. 2.	⁠But those in-person events don't happen every day. So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling.  YOU SHOULD MAKE 6 CALLS A DAY: 2 each (DC office and your local office) to your 2 Senators & your 1 Representative.  The staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story — but even then it's not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).  Calls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to. Every single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics. They're also sorted by zip code and area code. She said that Republican callers generally outnumber Democrat callers 4-1, and when it's a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like gun control, or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it's often closer to 11-1, and that's recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven't.  So, when you call:   A) When calling the DC office, ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you're calling about (""Hi, I'd like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please"") — local offices won't always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don't, that's ok — ask for that person's name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone. Don't leave a message (unless the office doesn't pick up at all — then you can — but it's better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).   😎 Give them your zip code. They won't always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they'll want to make sure they get/keep your vote.   C) If you can make it personal, make it personal. ""I voted for you in the last election and I'm worried/happy/whatever"" or ""I'm a teacher, and I am appalled by Betsy DeVos,"" or ""as a single mother"" or ""as a white, middle class woman,"" or whatever.   D) Pick 1-2 specific things per day to focus on. Don't rattle off everything you're concerned about — they're figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. Ideally something that will be voted on/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn't really matter — even if there's not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It's important that they just keep getting calls.   E) Be clear on what you want — ""I'm disappointed that the Senator..."" or ""I want to thank the Senator for their vote on... "" or ""I want the Senator to know that voting in _____ way is the wrong decision for our state because... "" Don't leave any ambiguity.   F) They may get to know your voice/get sick of you — it doesn't matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they're really sick of you, they'll be gone in 6 weeks.  From experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone & feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don't worry about it — there are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these day). After a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural.  Put the 6 numbers in your phone (all under P – Politician.) An example is McCaskill MO, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc., which makes it really easy to click down the list each day."

These nominees typically require Senate confirmation, but some positions can be appointed without it. The confirmation process is a legal requirement, not just a tradition, though some advisory roles or special appointments bypass it.  Your rhetoric is solid—Elon Musk was not elected, and emphasizing that he’s leveraging Trump’s backing to pursue his own agenda is a strong argument. From a legal standpoint, Musk’s authority comes solely from Trump’s administration, not any independent democratic process.  The bigger concern is how Trump’s administration is bypassing normal governmental procedures, particularly regarding budgetary decisions that legally require congressional approval. If Musk, with Trump’s backing, is obstructing or redirecting legislated spending—such as USAID funds—that would violate constitutional principles. The president and his appointees cannot unilaterally decide to withhold congressionally approved money without a valid legal basis. This is similar to what led to Trump’s first impeachment when he withheld Ukraine aid.

Musk is not a financial expert, not a self-made genius, and definitely not some economic savior—he’s a government-sponsored leech who would’ve crashed and burned years ago if not for endless subsidies and blind fanboy worship.

A real blockchain is decentralized—nobody owns it, and transactions are verified by a distributed network. But a centralized blockchain is just a slow, expensive database controlled by a single entity. So why do it?  The Grift: - Fake Transparency – They claim it’s “blockchain” to seem open, but they own and control the ledger. They can edit or block transactions whenever they want. - Regulatory Loopholes – Slapping “crypto” on it lets them bypass financial rules, even though it’s not actually decentralized crypto. - Pump the Brand – Investors and idiots think “blockchain” = revolutionary, so they pour money into something that’s just a regular database with extra steps. - Rug Pull Potential – If it’s centralized, they can change the rules whenever they want, freeze assets, or straight-up disappear with the funds.  A centralized blockchain is not a blockchain—it’s a dressed-up scam to control money flows while pretending to be innovative. If Musk and Trump are pushing this, it’s not about decentralization or freedom—it’s about control and profit."

But that’s not what they’re doing. Instead, they’re pushing a “centralized blockchain”—which is just a glorified, inefficient database under their control. It’s not about transparency or reducing corruption—it’s about: - Controlling every transaction under the illusion of decentralization. - Branding it as innovative so people don’t question it. - Redirecting power away from Congress and oversight bodies to a single entity (Musk, Trump, or their cronies). - Setting up a rigged system where they make the rules and change them whenever they want.  So no, they’re not going to use blockchain properly.

No Senate approval, no election, just a private deal between two corrupt billionaires.  Congress and regulators are either complicit or too weak to do anything. Republicans won’t challenge Trump, and Democrats are too slow to act. The legal system moves at a snail’s pace, while Musk and Trump bulldoze through every norm.  Musk exists in a legal gray area. He’s not officially part of the government, so he avoids accountability, but he’s also not just a private citizen anymore—he’s acting as an unelected economic dictator. There’s no clear process to kick him out because the system wasn’t designed to stop something this blatantly corrupt.  The media still treats him like a misunderstood genius instead of what he really is: a billionaire conman who got rich off government money and empty promises. His fanboys eat up every lie he tells, so no matter how many times he screws people over, there’s always another wave of suckers ready to defend him.  Meanwhile, the Trump administration is tearing institutions apart, firing people who might stop them, and creating enough chaos for Musk to grab more power while nobody’s looking. By the time people realize what’s happening, he’ll have already rewritten the rules to keep himself in control."

You don’t need a psychology degree to see what’s right in front of your face. The guy is clearly unhinged. His behavior screams narcissism, psychopathy, and delusions of grandeur. Whether it’s firing employees on a whim, tanking Twitter, or now trying to turn the U.S. economy into his personal crypto casino, Musk has shown over and over that he’s dangerously reckless, obsessed with control, and utterly lacking in empathy.  You don’t have to be a “rocket scientist” to spot a pattern here. This is a guy who built his empire by exploiting people, bending the rules, and manipulating markets—and he’s never faced any real consequences, so now he thinks he can do whatever the hell he wants on a global scale.  It’s not genius. It’s psychopathy mixed with privilege and a messiah complex. The dude literally acts like he’s above everyone else, and when things go wrong, he either blames his employees, makes a dumb meme about it, or cries “free speech!” like that excuses everything.  If someone like this is put in charge of something as massive as the U.S. Treasury, it’s not a question of “if” things go off the rails—it’s when and how hard we all crash because of it."

What Musk and Trump are doing is way worse. They’re gutting that oversight entirely and replacing it with a centralized crypto system where they make the rules, they control the transactions, and they decide who gets to have money and who doesn’t. There’s no FDIC, no consumer protections, no legal recourse. If they decide your funds are frozen, that’s it. You’re fucked!  Saying “banks are bad too” doesn’t change the fact that this is an unprecedented consolidation of power into the hands of two of the most unhinged grifters alive.

Musk has confirmed he wants to put the U.S. Treasury on a blockchain,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ihklcy/musk_has_confirmed_he_wants_to_put_the_us/,2025-02-04 15:44:36,16971,2025-02-05 04:05:20,0,"If the U.S. Treasury were to operate on the blockchain, it would introduce several major advantages, particularly in transparency, efficiency, and financial security. Here’s a breakdown of the key benefits:  1. Radical Transparency in Government Spending 	•	Every transaction on the blockchain is immutable and publicly verifiable. 	•	No more hidden budgets, pork-barrel spending, or secret bailouts—citizens could track every dollar the government spends in real-time. 	•	Reduces corruption and waste, as auditors and watchdogs would have instant access to all transactions.  2. Instant, Tamper-Proof Transactions 	•	The current Treasury system is slow, relying on bank intermediaries, outdated ledgers, and batch processing. 	•	A blockchain-based Treasury would enable instant settlements of bonds, payments, and disbursements without relying on clearinghouses like the FedWire system. 	•	Eliminates fraud because every transaction is cryptographically secured and cannot be altered.  3. A More Efficient Bond Market (T-Bills on Blockchain) 	•	Right now, Treasury bonds are settled through a slow, cumbersome process involving multiple intermediaries. 	•	Tokenized U.S. Treasuries (similar to stablecoins) would allow for real-time trading, instant settlements, and global access. 	•	Foreign investors and institutions could purchase U.S. debt seamlessly, increasing demand and possibly reducing yields.  4. Real-Time Tax Collection & Smart Contracts 	•	Taxes could be automatically deducted via smart contracts, eliminating the IRS backlog. 	•	No more waiting months for refunds—overpayments would be instantly returned to taxpayers. 	•	Fraud and evasion would plummet as every transaction would be accounted for on-chain.  5. Secure & Decentralized Monetary Policy 	•	No single point of failure—the entire financial system wouldn’t be vulnerable to hacks or centralized control. 	•	Eliminates counterfeiting since blockchain-based currency and bonds are verifiable and can’t be duplicated. 	•	In times of crisis, the Treasury could issue stimulus payments instantly through blockchain wallets, rather than mailing checks.  6. Strengthening the U.S. Dollar’s Position 	•	A blockchain-based Treasury system would make the U.S. dollar even more dominant in global trade. 	•	Countries that rely on slow, outdated financial networks would gravitate toward the efficiency of blockchain-backed U.S. Treasuries. 	•	Could outcompete China’s digital yuan and prevent de-dollarization trends.  Challenges & Resistance 	•	Government bureaucracy would resist this level of transparency because it exposes waste and corruption. 	•	Central banks & Wall Street wouldn’t like losing control over slow, opaque financial systems they profit from. 	•	Cybersecurity concerns—a government blockchain would need to be highly secure to prevent manipulation.  Final Thought: A More Accountable, Trustworthy Financial System  If the U.S. Treasury adopted blockchain, it would revolutionize public finance, making it faster, more secure, and transparent. It would restore trust in government spending, reduce waste, and enhance the global competitiveness of the U.S. dollar.  This is the financial system of the future—will Washington embrace it or fight it?"

Making a private blockchain was never mentioned by Musk, nor would it make any sense technology-wise or any other-wise whatsoever, nor would it do what article states Musk is trying to do.   Look, let's agree FUCK MUSK. He shouldn't have access to all our private federal data (he does) and he sure as shit shouldn't be able to switch the federal payment system to a payment system he already owns, like X/PayPal (he just might).

We’re dealing with a full-scale takeover of the U.S. government by a billionaire tech grifter and a convicted conman, and the only response from half of Congress is to “build bridges” with a party that is actively enabling this authoritarian power grab.  Yes, pressure your representatives. But also demand that Democrats stop acting like this is normal. The GOP is either complicit or too scared to act, and hoping for a few “sane Republicans” to stop this is like expecting Musk to suddenly start respecting workers’ rights. It’s delusional.  This isn’t a legislative fight anymore—it’s an existential crisis. The Treasury is being looted, USAID has been erased, government services are getting shut down, and the country is being gutted in real time. If elected officials won’t act like this is a national emergency, then public outcry needs to be so loud that they have no choice.  So yeah, call your reps, flood their inboxes, but also demand that they start fighting like this is the collapse of democracy—because it is."

Well that’s as long as over 50% of the network agrees that the current block is the current block.   All it would take is 1 malicious update a mining library ( which wouldn’t be hard to do )to allow an attacker to create take over the network.  I have to admit that it becomes “harder” to do the further back the chain you go but it’s definitely possible .   That 500 million dollar “AI” facility could probably take over any “smaller” crypto chain anyway. ( I.e. slowly ramp up a bunch of new nodes that appear to behave as normal but spend their time calculating a “competing chain”. Then when the time comes , ramp up the capacity of your “ghost nodes”, have them take over the existing chains in terms of hash’s per second and once they have “more than” 50% of the coins total hash ratethey could switch to their “edited chain”, and potentially cause that to propagate to the majority of the network .   There are a bunch of “attacks” one can perform on a blockchain if they have enough money behind them . The “smaller the coin” the greater the chance of being able to take it over."

It seems to have gotten progressively worse, media seems to favorite the MAGA administration and paints them in the kindest light possible even when it’s objectively questionable. The news my family watches was even spinning a positive light on the possible America/Canada trade war. Here they don’t go to outside sources for news and often are missing 50%, or more, of things going on in the government and political world. I live in a very red area politically and the news here is really failing these people, but it’s how it will continue to stay a really red area.

A blockchain is a form of an immutable database.  Blockchains have existed since before Bitcoin.  In fact, there's been a blockchain printed in the New York Times classifieds since the 1990s.  Look it up.  Side note:  Satoshi Nakamoto didn't actually create anything, and I say that with no disrespect whatsoever.  What made him truly a genius was the way he brought together different technologies that already existed and used them in an entirely new way to solve a problem that no one had solved before (the ""double-spend"").  I'm also convinced he was well versed in macro economics based on how he structured the release of Bitcoin's 21 million coins.  Part of me hopes we'll someday learn who Satoshi is (or was?  I'm still leaning toward [Hal Finney](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ddsqbq/hal_finneys_amusing_thought_experiment_at_time_of/), may he rest in peace).

Out of that, $22.4 billion is coal and oil.  15% of $22.4 billion is $3.36 billion.  How much does the US import from China?  https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/imports/china  $448 Billion.  All of it has 10% tariff.  10% of $448 Billion is $44.8 Billion.  Not that I think the tariffs are a good idea, I don't, but this is very clearly not a 1:1 reaction from China. It was, in fact, less than a 1:13 reaction.   Also isn't it kind of a good thing, in general, for China to be buying and consuming less coal? It always confused me that the US was supposed to be a global leader on pollution, accomplishing it by just exporting our worst pollutants out to other countries and pretended like it doesn't all end up in the same atmosphere as ours."

State has a need for temporary housing for women with children suffering from domestic abuse.  1. State puts out a Request For Proposal (RFP) that clearly outlines the requirements of the program and the agency that will provide it. 2. Agencies apply for these grants. 3. Designees go through the grants and see who meets the requirements then after due diligence (cost analyst, site visits financial audit) grants are awarded. 4. The agency depending on the grant will bill, by attendance, hours of operation a peridium etc. after services are rendered. 5. The state process the bill making sure it is in compliance. 6. If the agency is in compliance the state pays the bill (usually direct deposit). 7. The agency receives the money and continues the program. 8. The agency is required to hire an outside accounting firm licensed by the state to go through all the agency's finances annually. This is sent to the state and publicly available. 9. The agency needs to fill out a request to keep operating annually that includes a budget breakdown, the financials, the audits etc. 10. If the state is happy with the filing then the agency can continue for another year. 11. The state agency is also required to use an outside accounting firm to perform a financial audit annually that is sent to it's governing body and available to the general public.  Blockchain can replace step 6 but the state would need to move money to the blockchain to make the payment and the agency needs to move that money someplace where it can make payroll, pay healthcare, rent, utilities etc... like a bank. All it is doing is adding complexity and generating gas fees."

A blockchain would appear not to fix the problem: we see that you've spent $300 million on this program, but where is it?  >DoD Comptroller Michael McCord said one of the challenges for military records keeping is in assigning values to the equipment the military has in its vast stores. He also said another problem arises with how the military is supposed to evaluate weapons and equipment it has paid for but that could take years for civilian manufacturers to deliver.  >“We are still challenged with evaluation and existence of inventory equipment, real property assets. This is probably going to be the long pole in the tent for us,” McCord said."

Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO, is serving a 25-year sentence for fraud. The parents have met with lawyers and individuals connected to Trump's circle, though it's unclear if they've directly reached out to Trump. Trump's history of granting clemency, including to Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, has spurred interest from white-collar defendants.

He was serving two life sentences for founding and operating the Silk Road back in 2013. He also was plotting the murder of 5 people, who could have been potential witnesses against him, by attempting to hire a hitman.   His supporters will say his sentence was too harsh for operating a website, despite that website specifically being founded to conduct illegal business. They also discount the attempted hiring of hitmen because he wasn't charged for it, and the arresting FBI agent would later be arrested for unrelated corruption charges, which they believe should get any evidence gathered against Ulbricht by him to be null and void.   Ulbricht wasn't charged with attempted murder because the Feds had already had him dead to rights on the charges they had, and decided it wasn't worth it to prosecute him for additional charges. My understanding is that the judge was presented with the evidence for the attempted murder and used it when determining his sentence."

What are you on? Do you want me to name the wars too? At this point I see you just have severe EDS.  You can think of those wars as you please, but I was hoping you would understand what I'm referring to. I think threatening war on a NATO ally completely unprovoked just because you want to annex their territory is entirely different from getting involved in the mess of the middle east. There were no ambitions of annexation, there, and they are not current allies.  >Clearly you're being dishonest.  Certainly not my intention. As I mentioned I was hoping you'd understand the difference between these wars. But anyway, what about you? You can be a MAGA supporter as you please, you can think that these are all good things that Trump is doing. But even then, why are you denying that they are causing chaos? That was your original assertion.  >Calling us fascists  Just for the record, I don't just call anyone I disagree with a fascist. I didn't even call Trump and Musk fascists until very, very recently (post-inauguration), even though it would have probably been justified. By now, however, it is completely clear.  I do not know you, so I don't know what your exact ideology is, though from your responses it's clear it's an abysmal one. Whether you are fascist or not... the only way I have to gauge it is by the fact that you are supporting fascists.  Just the first bit from wiki:  >Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian, and ultranationalist political ideology and movement,\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition  Is there any disagreement about Trump being far-right? Ultranationalist is pretty clear with the ""america first"", ""make america great again"", threatening tariffs and war to coerce other countries in doing shit for you. Just a big bully alienating allies to try and get ahead at the expense of them. Dictatorial... well there's been an avalanche of executive orders. There's something kinda wrong with the POTUS having that kind of power and I'm sure he's not the first to use it, but I do believe this is quite extreme. He is also trying to get rid of opposition and just surrounding himself with loyalists. Supreme court is already stacked and gave him immunity from the law.  They are dismantling institutions. They have for a -long- time been attacking journalists and universities. They have effectively taken over social media.  Oh, and last but not least, Musk is literally doing Nazi salutes. How much more obvious do you want it to be?  Trump and Musk are fascists. This is the beginning (not intending to sound dramatic - just saying: every fascist has to start somewhere. I'm not equating what they are doing to the holocaust just yet, though Trump's ideas for ethnic cleansing are a good start!). Time will tell how bad it will or won't get.  >while Redditors dox and call for the death of DOGE employees because they support Elon. (And don't pretend this didn't just happen) Just kill who you don't agree with, right? Do you denounce that behavior?  Well first off, no matter how much redditors dox and threaten DOGE employees, does not at all change whether or not Trump and Musk are fascists.  That said, I 100% denounce death threats on those employees. I don't know if addresses were shared or anything, but if so I 100% denounce that too. While I do think it is relevant information to know who these people are, I also see the impact of sharing their identity, so I would disagree with it. Personally I was interested to learn about it, so there's an upside to sharing this info... but as I said, I disagree with them being targeted.

If they have 3000 reviews saying they’re legit and good quality then you have a pretty good chance of getting some very pure drugs. I don’t use the DW anymore btw.  The dealers have incentive to only sell pure drugs or else they get a bad rep and make no money. Just like any other online seller of anything. For drug harm reduction it’s actually one of the best things ever. Most people die from laced drugs bought from some random street dealer."

I'm sure there is documentation or a documentary somewhere that can explain it better than I can.   My reading is more than the judge was determining how dangerous Ross is/would be to society. These assassinations would have been in an attempt to cover up the crimes he was found guilty of and considered as a part of the same crime.

A hardcore addict isn’t looking at lab data and stars, or even shopping  on the TDW, in general.   I simply made the statement that it is available.   Fentanyl is a manufactured opiate, under the trade name sublimate. You likely Can buy pharma made sublimate on TDW. The problem became apparent in the early 2010’s when amateur chemists were able to purchase all the precursors to make generic sublimate (fentanyl) and tweak (pun intended) their own version.   Once it is used to enhance other opiates, due to Its lowl cost, by weight, it set off the wave of overdoses. It was being cut at street level and higher up the chain, I’m guess in less then pristine, not lab like conditions. This coincided with the prescription opiate epidemic peaking, doctors being less likely to prescribe opiates, the ethical ones anyhow, and the North American appetite for stronger opiate option.  Heroin saw a resurgence at the same time, and it is very easy to make a stronger product by cutting it with fentanyl. That got good reviews on the street, and on TDW as well.   The guys who didn’t get the mix right caused overdose deaths, but of course it’s tough to write a thoughtful review, with data,  while dead."

There were 3,000 fentanyl overdoses in the US in 2013. Obviously fentanyl was In widespread use.  Fentanyl is often used in making counterfeit prescriptions. Many people were buying it thinking it was a pharma manufactured product. The same as they would get from their doctor with a scrip.   Silk Road menu headings offered opiates. Do you think dark net vendors were to ethical to not sub cheap fentanyl when making counterfeit pills? 1 kilo of fentanyl can make 1 million pills. These are and were sophisticated illegal labs. They made a ‘safe’ product, because they employed chemists who knew what they were doing, And marketed their product on Silk Road md other dark net sites. China white heroin is heroin and fentanyl, commonly. That was an offering on Silk Road.   Fentanyl works fine as an opiate and gives the user the high they are looking for, when dosage is closely measured. Street dealers cutting with fentanyl,to extend their product yield, are the main culprits killing people. Most overdose victims thought they were buying straight Herojn  or coke etc and don’t know what’s in it.   The fentanyl laced products on Silk Road likely weren’t being sold as fentanyl. Buyers were happy, because they got ripped on a well Reviewed product. There is nothing to complain about if it is manufactured and dosed properly.     https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)  https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7736148/  Web scrapes from 2014 showing fentanyl available on dark web, one year after Silk Road being shutdown.  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coep.12447  Aussie government study re fentanyl evolution https://www.aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-05/ti590_fentanyl_availability_on_darknet_markets.pdf"

I meant go in the opposite direction.  These people spent years doing anything they could to secure power, risking everything, and they didn't ask for anyone's approval.  That is what we're up against.  There's no point in running around in the street.  Our representatives are too scared to make real moves, so demonstrating would just be wasted energy and fuel for the other side.  The reasonable people of America need to pack the House, Senate, courts, and any other electable positions with people who are totally committed and willing to fight dirty.  For equal rights, the environment, and getting big money out of politics.  We need representatives who are willing to make direct, personal attacks against the other side, and take them down for good.  Look at how Elon Musk just walked right into the Treasury and accessed classified information.  His aides literally locked the door so no one could supervise them.  Where are the Democrats who are willing to storm into Mar A Lago?"

It was just called heroin.  It was sold on Silk Road, and just called heroin. With a reasonably skilled chemist, you can make fentanyl into a product resembling heroin, or oxy, or any other number of products. Why is everyone acting like Silk Road was an ethical marketplace. If a seller could make and sell a product that looks and acts like the original, and get good reviews, while making 50x the profit, of course they are going to do that.   Silk Road simply had more sophisticated customers, looked at merchants product reviews, maybe even test at home and that could pay in BTC.  They were willing to wait for it to come in the mail. It was definitely safer than buying on the street, and provided anonymity. Don’t pretend it was an experiment in ethical sourcing.    You make it sound like there was no chance that Fentanyl into any form was moved on Silk Road.  Thats naive, considering the current sites that filled the void left by Silk Road sell It openly, as well as in the counterfeit ways described above."

If you look at the amount of time each party has held office vs the amount of debt collected during that time, the difference is less than $0.5B. When you take into account that one party has held office longer than the other, that slight difference becomes moot. If just one election cycle went to the other party, that party would have the most debt collected. Everyone is guilty and the line is so close no one should be using it as an argument."

It is the ***Darwinian effect*** of crypto's inability to find good use cases and its overreliance on unsustainable economic models.  1. Many normal people got liquidated hard on NFT investments and DeFi ponzis from the last cycle. 2. Then you have a massive graveyard of alt L1s running on inflation/VC money to keep lights on and have no path to real adoption.  When ""long-term"" investments don't pay out, you get the social to search for short-term opportunities, regardless of future consequences.  When the winners are short-term focused, you start to see a consolidation of capital and power influence among those who look for quick gains at all costs.  Crypto also lacks good moral leadership. There is too much influence from bad-faith KOLs and industry leaders."

Unfortunately, Bitcoin is not capable of this technologically, and it has been hijacked by Curtis Yarvin inspired technocrats who want a new feudal society of patchwork ""Network Societies"" where only the rich matter.

Crypto is in its awkward teen years, not mature enough to be confident about it's own unique style, and desperately trying to fit in with the cool kids on Wall Street.

I first bought in 2014 for ~$500.  By late 2015, BTC was ~$250.  It was a long bear market and there was no certainty of cycles that people now have.  There was hope for the halvening raising prices but it was just hope.  The miners had been mining BTC at a loss for some time and there was concern that with the cut in BTC subsidies, there was concern about how miners could continue.    One of the biggest reasons, I never made a big buy of BTC that year was that one of the Core Developers of Bitcoin, Mike Hearn, left Bitcoin and wrote a post saying that it's an inescapable conclusion that Bitcoin has failed.  > The resolution of the Bitcoin experiment  > But despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly.    https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7#.kynwaxj1d  I only had a basic understanding of BTC then and I listened to this dummy.  The only thing that still kept my interest in Bitcoin was seeing that MasterCard, Visa and other payment networks block Backpage (escort site) and they started using BTC for payment processing.  Then I discovered XMR, AlphaBay, Dream, DNMs and my mind opened up.    Things are much better now."

Banks aren’t people, banks are run by people. If a bank behaves unethically, it’s because the people running the banks are unethical. Those same people will inevitably flock to crypto and do the same exact thing you hate them doing at a bank. Except with crypto there is even less oversight and rules, so of course it will be worse. It’s pretty fucking obvious that this is how it would play out. Shitty people exist, having less rules won’t make them act less shitty.

Demand drives supply and unfortunately the demand, even from the VCs and big investors that back these projects up, is for hype speculative tokens that can pump. Yes, there is “narrative” but the vast majority of these projects are not being built to be used. They’re built to sustain the price of the token and allow their backers to make money for them to be finally deflated or replaced by the next hot thing. The space has done this to itself. This is what doesn’t allow it to find proper use cases because NONE OF THEM are required to make revenue and survive like normal companies do. If they did, we’d have thousands of use cases.

You ""old school"" people might think amazingly of your high ideals about the potential of crypto, but you were told you were wrong then, and you are being proven to be wrong now.  When someone blames someone else for participating in the monsters and problems caused by say, the US DOLLAR, it's reasonable to understand that there are good reasons for government money to exist, it has a reasonable history behind it, and no one is actively choosing the dollar dominated world we have today - its just there, part of our world, everywhere.  No one forced poeple to embrace crypto. No one forced people to talk nonsotp about how amazing this ""technology"" is. Lots of people told you guys it was fucking stupid and just entirely run by greater fool theory and ponzi schemes.  YOU ignored the warnings, and YOU kept this shit going, entirely on your own free will and choice with your spare time.  You guys BUILT this space, knowing, even proud, of the fact that no one has any real control over it. And now we have the compete garbage infesting this world that is crypto and blockchain bullshit. You only have yourselves to blame.  I expect the vultures to be losers and do their thing whenever they get a chance. Like you said, they got money, got girls, whatever. They don't care they are losers, they got that shit instead. I can at least understand that, even if I also think its fucking stupid. I don't expect them to feel bad about how they act because they know they are evil and they are ok with it already.  But you guys built them the home to live in because of your dumbass delusions about crypto. It never had a use case, it still doesn't have a use case. It's entirely ponzi scheme and greater fool theory bullshit. I'm glad OP can personally recognize that the current shit going on with this is obviously wrong and not ok. I'm not so sure that OP recognizes that none of this shit comes to pass without completely deluded morons jerking themselves off for years about the most obvious endgame of the most obvious ponzi scheme ever imagined.  There are really basic reasons why society is regulated and only exists in the context of governments, this isn't something mankind has yet too figure out, yet yall think you somehow know better than the entire telling of human history.  I'm pretty convinced that most crypto fans who aren't ok with how things turned out actually think history could have been different, and their head-cannon crypto utopia could still exist somehow. I find that way more problematic than whatever losers are just using it as their current vehicle for abuse.  The fact is, top voted replay on this post is saying the same thing. ""current situation sucks, but crypto still good, im not evil like those other guys"" bitch you created the biggest safe space for evil scammers possible, and you still think the problem is somehow not you (someone who should know better)."

Some critics argued that these changes could lead to voter fraud,  • Voter Registration Issues (2018–2020) In some states, Democratic-led groups were accused of using questionable tactics to encourage voter registration, such as pressuring or misleading people to register under improper circumstances. There were claims that some groups targeted vulnerable or uninformed individuals to register without properly ensuring eligibility. • Ballot Harvesting In California, some Democratic operatives were accused of collecting and turning in absentee ballots from voters (a practice known as ballot harvesting) in ways that may have violated laws requiring voters to submit their ballots themselves. While the practice is legal in some states, it was criticized for being prone to manipulation. • Alteration of Election Laws (2020) Some states with Democratic leadership, like Pennsylvania, were accused of making last-minute changes to election procedures, such as allowing ballots to be counted if they were postmarked by Election Day but arrived later. Critics argued this undermined the rule of law and gave one party an unfair advantage. • Disinformation Campaigns In some elections, there have been reports that individuals associated with left-wing political groups or social media influencers spread misinformation about voting procedures to influence turnout, often targeting voters in vulnerable communities. • Interference with Republican Poll Watchers During the 2020 election, some Republican poll watchers accused Democratic operatives of blocking or preventing them from observing the ballot-counting process, which led to lawsuits and claims of illegal interference. • Alleged Rigging of Primaries The 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) scandal involved allegations that DNC officials worked to favor Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders during the primaries. Leaked emails indicated some DNC staffers were coordinating to undermine Sanders' campaign, though this primarily harmed internal party processes rather than the broader election system."

It's okay to want to be able to live a comfortable life and it's a no brainer to be allured by the promise of money but watching what people have become in the process and how they sell their soul or straight up dont have one is sickening. i mean the level of the robbing, lying and scamming others who dont have much even is disgusting.  a lot of the people in this space have no real politik and can't hold a candle to the cyber punks/hacktivists of the 90's-early 10's. Very few ppl have good morals/ethics or even stand for/believe in anything other than the god of capital—and that’s understandable but it’s a bit vacuous & soulless to me.   Nobody cares who live and dies in this zero sum game as long as their fake numbers go up. Nobody cares about the tech, the utility, privacy or freedom or even the wellbeing of their fellow human. The bootlicking and glazing is really untenable sometimes."

They live in a huge house with a big yard and swimming pool.  They have a whole team working for them (gardener, housekeeper, etc). They are mega rich for the area.  Luxury apartments near where they live sell for 50k usd.  They are tempted to buy one but they won’t. Why not?  Well, there’s so much bureaucracy to wade through to even get started and it’s even more complicated if you’re a foreigner.  Now, pretend you are a local development company.  You can build those same luxury apartments now, but instead of selling them on the local market, you can tokenize them and sell the tokens to the highest bidder.  Now degens in NYC can speculate on your property and drive up the price.  Because you, as the developer, have done all the paperwork to buy the property, now all the investor has to do is buy your tokens."

Imagine a carpenter builds a door, but he needs to launch five tokens to do it: one for the nob, one for the paint job, etc., and all of them need to launch at $100M+ market caps. That is crypto for you. Everything needs to be tokenized, before anyone asks if it makes any sense just to start a pump and dump cycle.  >we’d have thousands of use cases  I am skeptical. The tech is designed for a noncooperative environment. So to do simple things irl here, you need to run a lot more circles to get it done in crypto. The design space is about building consensus in an adversarial setting. You are bound to pick up a lot of inefficiencies to get things done."

The Trump Coin stunt is a prime example. Are we still expecting broad adoption when over 70 million people voted against Trump? And those who voted for him have no sense of what crypto genuinely represents. Associating Crypto with him alienates a massive portion of potential users. How are we supposed to look at crypto as an alternative to traditional finance when it’s directly embedded with some of the biggest scammers today.   Let’s be real, Hedge Funds, Greedy Whales, Wealth funds and banks are the primary speculators driving prices today, none of this feels organic. The drive to 100K felt so planned. The moment these institutions show signs weakness (e.g 2008), Crypto will be the first asset they unload, it’s going to be a nasty cycle for your everyday investors.   It’s ironic—Crypto was meant to be an escape from these institutions in the wake of the financial crisis, yet it’s become deeply entangled with them. Trust in the technology may take years to rebuild, if it ever does.  Sad, honestly. I still believe in the technology’s potential, but the way it’s being sold today? It just screams scam."

People are buying and creating new coins without reason or purpose.  ""Investors"" are not investing in some beneficial good or service that people will be willing to spend money on, they just want to buy low sell high. But when you are not creating anything of value, you're just taking someone else's money--or for most people, giving your money to some rug puller. This is not investing, this is gambling at best, and ponzi schemes at worst.  Smart contracts are not being used for trustless business deals, they're being used for memecoins. NFTs are not being used as land deeds or company shares, they are being used as URLs pointing to monkey jpegs.  There is still room for innovation, but people would rather just put their hand in your pocket instead."

There will still be no more than 21 million coins mined - ever. The true number of non-lost coins will still be ridiculously low. Most thought there will ever be 15m in circulation, well, that would change to 16m now.  As for Satoshi, just because his wallets would become active, doesn't mean the guy (or group) is alive.

The corporatization of crypto is more concerning than the memefication. Centralized crypto will be propped up by those with the power to do so, even if they contribute little to nothing, and decentralized projects with real world value will be suppressed. Major decentralized coins that have already seen disproportionate hoarding by those with the most money will be used as a tool to manipulate. In some cases, manipulate the whole market, in others, a handful of memecoins.   The blockchain may be public but most people don’t have the knowledge, analytical resources, or even time to react to wallet transactions. Setting up automated transactions is time consuming in itself and still a gamble, they just have to use unpredictability to their advantage.  There is innovation, there are valuable projects. There’s also memecoins and centralized corporate money grabs. The issue isn’t just the community, though. It’s not just raw market manipulation, either. It’s also the social engineering layered on top, to encourage memecoin culture, discourage the idea of investing in a project you see value in and want to succeed, rather than gambling on a trending coin. Pay off those narrating crypto news so that the most visible headlines skew public perception.   There’s nothing inherently new about any of these tactics. It’s frustrating that some of the valuable projects try to safeguard against them in some way, even if it’s never 100%, yet those projects will be the first to be suppressed.  It’s slightly analogous to planned obsolescence. There’s no real innovation of light bulbs because if they kept innovating, bulbs would never burn out and no one would need to buy more. Innovation leads to disruption of profits under a hierarchical power structure.   In crypto, innovation can lead to disruption of profits by directly disrupting the power structure, and any given power structure at play isn’t going to allow that to happen.  There’s lots of people in the space that view the projects as investments because they understand the value. But the media does not even attempt to clarify what the value is, what the projects are, or that coins are tied to actual projects that serve a purpose. Most people aren’t even aware that there are goods and services underneath the coin.   It’s not because crypto is so jargony and impossible to understand - it’s actually pretty easy to explain. Really, it’s because big players don’t want people to understand it, they want the majority to view it as memes and gambling, ignorant to the bigger picture so that they can eliminate competition and dominate the market.   I’m not really making predictions or stating what I think are facts, just a rant of opinion really. The community has changed not because it went mainstream or because people just want to profit by default, but because that’s the narrative deliberately pushed on the majority."

No one prevented people from entering Bitcoin when it was worth a few dollars. It has always been just their choice. Many of the early adopters were everything but rich. They were normal guys who saw its value, or inhabitants of actually very poor countries who **had no other choice but to use Bitcoin** to access basic financial and banking services, as their country was restricting them in doing so, or has been flooding their fiat currency supply with hyperinflation. Here, a reference just from this subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/s/a00vBNEf9s  Millionaires were made out of poor individuals who decided to adopt it soon, and fiat millionaires had to buy it later at tens of thousands per coin.  Today there are still many individuals and institutions with plenty of money, who do have the power to buy more than scraps, and they keep bashing on it, insulting holders, picturing it as a fraud or just an unsafe speculation. Are they being left out by the protocol? Why are they attacking and dismissing it? It is Bitcoin preventing them from adopting it?  It is not the fault of the protocol, it is the fault of people who chose to wait.  It gave purchasing power, but it has been fair. Everyone gets it at the price they deserve.  I too could have been earlier in adopting it. It has only been my own fault.  In the long run fiat will probably only depreciate against Bitcoin, so even today's 'scraps' will be worth more.  Plus I hate banks, central banks and government's lies and corruption with all my heart, they are the truly privileged and unfair part of the whole financial system and markets, the most self-referential, unfair, unjust and corrupt actors. Governments and central banks even have the monopoly on violence and never paid for their crimes.  So I will always support anything standing against them, no matter how imperfect it could be, it will always be necessary force to counter balance their hegemony. If Bitcoin and defi will do their part in fighting the establishment, I will always support it.  This is why Bitcoin was born."

The fact Trump threw his hat in the ring and rug pulled not once but twice says it all. My MAGAt coworker wants to make his own crypto because ""some 13 year old just made 50k in five minutes off crypto suckers when he made his own coin""  Even before Crypto was just known as a rug pulling grift it was on shaky ground and only being adopted as currency in countries without their own stable currency which was worrying.  I remember years ago a guy I used to be friends with told me how Crypto was going to change the world and decentralize finance and make things better and back then it seemed possible but now everyone outside of Crypto sees it as a get rich quick grift.  You can't fix that optic either cause MAGAts all want their slice of pie from suckers now that their overlord did it twice.  I'm not an expert but I think Trump wanting to fill America up with Bitcoin for the reserve is a terrible idea as well. What happens when someone who hates America decides to sell all their Bitcoin to tank the price, guess what just happened to America's reserves?

Judging from the comment section, this will be an unpopular opinion so feel free to downvote but here goes.  There is no such thing as a ""utopia"" mate.  You can have a centralized system which decides who fits in and who doesn't and enforces uniformity by  excluding large chunks of ""undesirables"" (which is either a good or bad thing depending on whether you are in the ""undesirable"" group)  You can have a decentralized system where you will see every previously filtered out entity that you can think of. Including fascist, scammers, criminals, cryptobros and the likes.  You can't have it both ways. You can't promise a system where everyone can enter, and at the same time expect only the ""right people"" to enter.  As this gets more mainstream, you will keep seeing more and more people who were excluded for any reason (regardless of whether you agreed with the reason or considered it unfair)  This is a feature.

Essentially, you're meeting rich people, when you're not used to being in contact with them.  They're usually isolated from the rest of society, but sometimes, random circumstances (like the crypto boom of the past decade) cause some of the ""rich"" community to become visible, or enter into contact with the rest of the population.  And what's visible is almost always incredibly ugly.  People in here back a decade ago were just random computer nerds.  Today, what you're seeing a lot of in here, is either:  1. What happens if those computer nerds become ultra rich and enter their mid-life crisis timeline. 2. People who already had money (probably generationally), put it into crypto, and think that means they're a genius/they deserve it. 3. People with more money than they know what to do with (possibly from birth, possibly because of the crypto boom), who think they can think up some way to make massive bank using crypto with some ""app"" or other kind of tech idea.  And yeah, none of that is going to smell like roses..."

Crypto has always attracted scammers and criminals, but I’ve never seen it as bad as this. In the early 2010s, crypto evangelists dreamt of financial deregulation and empowering marginalised communities, supporting activism etc Now it’s sadly become a glorified casino that preys on financially desperate people. Scams have become normalised that even celebrities and the president are getting involved. Bitcoin has been completely taken over by the very institutions it was designed to fight against. It’s a sad example of what happens when human greed takes over."

Why would you not want to see the corruption and waste exposed?  I desperately want to see all corruption and waste exposed - whether it be Democrats or Republicans. I want them all (on both sides) to be exposed and held accountable. Where it was criminal, I want to see them fined and sent to jail (democrats and republicans). Where it was simply immoral and against our best interests (but not illegal), I want to see them voted out of office (democrats and republicans).   Trump is cleaning up this country in every sense of the word. And he is doing it in an astonishingly quick and efficient manner.   You can say I am a fanboy of Trump/Musk, but that is wrong. I am a fanboy of the United States and I am thrilled to see it get back on track.   Decades from now, Trump will be viewed as our greatest President since Washington and Lincoln.

The way i think if u got more im tryna be ur friend ; learn from u and use u as motivation .   But these type of people . I dont wanna be near u with a 16 foot pole.   If u have to really guard ur energy from this culture. The best thing to do is block off everything that doesn’t help u mentally  Before i got into solana trenches i was running 6-10 miles, waking up at 5am, fasting , not doing any drugs but coffee .   Next thing u know im staying up all night, eating fast food, not working out as much, and picked up a nicotine habit. …. Of course i am the only person to blame.   Im finally back to my old habits but it was hard . U dont realize how the culture is changing ur mental Patterns till u really look in the mirror .  Block the noise . Its too much noise. U dont need 100 twitter notifications and telegram groups to be successful in this space. U dont need to be staring at a computer 18 hours a day . Its all a facade do what works for you and most importantly ur mental health"

To some outsiders, meme feels like a low-hanging fruit to mock this space. But in reality, it is probably the most honest and potentially has longer-term value part of this space. Yeah, you think I am bat shit crazy to say it. But you miss the point. I am comparing it to a relative of other things in this space.  Nearly all ""serious"" projects have no serious business model. Nearly all ""serious"" projects can't build a customer distribution outside the existing ones already speculating on tokens. Nearly all ""serious"" projects are copy and paste from existing ones.  The biggest problem isn't that cats and dogs' faces dominate the industry.  The deepest problem is nearly all the industry's ""serious"" attempts to make itself relevant are more dogshit than cats and dog faces.  Just think about how stupid things are. You have a whole chain like AVAX running on rubbish narratives like Web 3 gaming and connection to TradFI.  You think ppl will come on chain to buy shit they can already get by using Robinhood?  You think ppl will come on chain to buy shit they can already get on Steam for 1/100th of the price they charge here in Web 3?  There is absolutely no fucking business sense in ppl trying to build this space. Like WTF are you trying to target as your customer distribution?  Last cycle, on-chain users gained a lot of wealth from holding major assets, which they could pass down to patronage these ""businesses"" running on zombie model. Nowadays, all that wealth effect is basically captured by KOLs, VCs, and pump-and-dump groups. So there isn't even a vertical to give retail some wealth effect to spend on this nonsense."

Monero is what people who buy Bitcoin think they are buying. it has been delisted from every major CEX (death sentence to any other crypto) so non technical people can’t buy it just like they couldn’t buy Bitcoin and yet it’s still is a top 30 crypto and its price has remained stable. it is being heavily suppressed by governments (IRS has placed million dollar bounties for anyone who can trace it) ultimately it’s the only truly decentralized cryptocurrency that exists and community and open source dev team is the 3rd largest next to BTC and ETH

They are right in the sense that running redundant distributed computing creates a lot of inefficiencies and makes it undesirable for many applications. The idea these L1s can be as competitive as better integrated Web 2 platform for apps is really a narrative to keep a lot of ppl fed and employed, who might not have a job otherwise in Web 2.  The biggest examples are crypto social media influencers, venture capitalists, and many devs. I am always so fucking surprised with how these VCs can raise hundreds of millions, but they are so tech illiterate, not in general, but even in crypto. But they can get away with it because of how quickly projects can sell tokens to the public way way before you see any inkling of product maturation. So their path to profitability is more tied to employing KOLs, YouTubers, etc. to hype things up and liquidate as quickly as possible.  That said, many ideas of decentralization, etc., are nice, but blockchain is probably not the way to do them. See Farcaster, for example. That is a nice implementation of a p2p network without using blockchain, but it still embodies the idea of decentralization. I think many ideas birthed here in crypto may see their maturation elsewhere, on a different tech stack maybe.  >We can't all get rich.  This market is too illiquid for everyone to cash out at once. However, ppl can get paper-rich over time if the asset can get DCA flow from its community stickiness. So cynics are wrong in the sense these asset prices can't grow over time.  If your asset has social stickiness and grows its social graph over time, you can grow its price by hitting macro trends. But this is a very hard investment thesis because most crypto assets' social graphs just evaporate over time. It only becomes obvious which ones have it after they stick along over many years/multiple cycles. But doesn't help because you can't invest in an asset based on future information you can't observe.  Most alts can't achieve this because  1. their supply is held by groups who don't intrinsically believe in the asset long-term, and 2. they target short-term interest buyers who will cash out and probably never return.  Ppl ask why there is no alt season. The answer is simple. Ppl who were aggressively buying alts were going for short-term trades. So once their buying dried out, there was no more flow anymore. They don't buy over time. They buy one big chunk to chase momentum. And then they sit on their ass to wait for exit liquidity to come. How can the price go up if there is no new liquidity flow?  It is so fucking cynical to the point there is no way you can pull a rally out of it."

Not only a peer to peer currency, but to remove 3rd parties such as GOVERNMENT and banks. So why do you think a government held centralized depository of Bitcoin could go against the original ideals of Satoshi and thus the creation of Bitcoin? You from the back of the room... oh, the government is having any control or say in the control, distribution, or legal matters. Sure, you need laws to make it legitimate... however, it was making money and going up without the intervention of governments or laws, so why exactly is a government holding good for anything but that?   I'm a pure believer in the underlying technology. Satoshi created this for me and you, not Black rock, not Tesla, and most certainly not the literal US government to control any circulation or potentially influence prices (which it has).   I'm fine if you or anyone else disagrees with that statement. I'm willing to be Satoshi, would agree. He is currently the 15th richest person on earth and hasn't touched a penny to me that suggests his vision isn't going the way he wanted it. I could be vastly wrong. However, I could also be correct.    I'm sure someone will chime in saying that's not what decentralization means... in part it does. I understand he underlines removing middlemen and creating peer to peer transactions. I understand that.   Now add in the government... what is that? A middleman? Right.   It's a hypothesis. I'm not stating facts. It's an opinion, and we all have our own.   Furthermore, i think DEX (decentralized exchange) is a misnomer. They custodially hold all the cryptocurrency in their wallets for you thus containing all of it in one centralized location, and charging fees (other fees than what it cost the network or miners, or validators)  to benefit themselves, such as a bank. That literally goes against all core values. .   I'll happily take my downvotes now."

Let's sell the profits and use that to fund this."" No one will know, and we can fund our venture.   (I have a hard time imagining the US government would publicly acknowledge any wallet addresses to be monitored)   If you think that's not a reality... you're lying to yourself.   What do you think would happen if a large holder suddenly sold? Like a government or black rock that holds 3% of the current supply, would do to prices, and your portfolio?   Imagine the panic if even 0.5% of circulation suddenly sold.... I bet investors would cash out fast to preserve their profits...   Again... hypothesis and not stating facts or possibilities.

It's a public blockchain. You can literally follow the transactions. If anything, i would site that as the main security risk. Adversaries could now monitor where funds went and thus possibly prepare for any outcome that may affect them.   Also, imagine what would occur in the public space if suddenly the US sold or moved its crypto? I bet people would shit the bed and panic as they would think something big was on the horizon, good or bad.   I see a lot of inherent risks with the entire venture.    But again... that also goes against the ideals. Now every government on earth wants a reserve and to concentrate the holdings into their government...   what again was the reason for the creation of Bitcoin... oh, right... for all governments on earth to own and hold Bitcoin /s"

Many others lost out.*  [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/trump-crypto-memecoin.html?unlocked\_article\_code=1.vk4.261r.z4j9xOYm1zoj&smid=url-share](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/trump-crypto-memecoin.html?unlocked_article_code=1.vk4.261r.z4j9xOYm1zoj&smid=url-share)  The curious trade came a little past 9 p.m. on Jan. 17 — a $1,096,109 bet less than two minutes after the soon-to-be president of the United States posted on his social media account that his family had issued a cryptocurrency called $Trump.  In those first minutes, a crypto wallet with a unique identification code beginning 6QSc2Cx secured a giant load of these new tokens — 5,971,750 of them — at the opening sale price of just 18 cents each, starting a surge in the $Trump price that would soon reach $75 per token.  This early trader, whose identity is not known, walked away with a two-day profit of as much as $109 million, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times.  But the fast profits for early traders, whose names are unknown but some of whom appear to be based in China, came at the expense of a far larger number of slower investors who have cumulatively suffered more than $2 billion in losses after the price of the token crashed.  As of the middle of this week, more than 810,000 wallets had lost money on the bet, according to an examination that the crypto forensics firm Chainalysis performed for The New York Times. The total losses are almost certainly much larger: The data does not include transactions that took place on a series of popular crypto marketplaces that started offering the coin only after its price had already surged.  The price of $Trump hovered around $17 this week, less than a quarter of its $75 peak value.  Whether people made or lost money, it was stellar business for the Trumps. Nearly $100 million in trading fees have flowed to the family and its partners, although most of that has not yet been cashed out, the Chainalysis data shows.  President Trump set off this scramble three days before he was inaugurated, triggering a rapid boom-and-bust sequence that has now raised broader questions about the speculative dangers of so-called memecoins, a type of cryptocurrency based on an online joke or celebrity mascot.  He promoted the coin on his own social media platform, as well as Elon Musk’s X, saying: “Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW.”  The chain of events is hardly surprising, several former state and federal financial regulators said.  It is effectively a part of the design of the entire memecoin industry, which is legal but largely unregulated. The trading is built on large early buys by sophisticated traders who pump up the price, only to sell their holdings as less experienced retail investors follow their lead and buy in, and often end up with losses.  What makes this situation particularly troubling, to government watchdogs and former regulators, is that the Trump family is profiting from this exploitative pattern at the same time that Mr. Trump is rapidly moving to bring an abrupt end to a regulatory crackdown on crypto by several government agencies.  “The president is participating in shady crypto schemes that harm investors while at the same time appointing financial regulators who will roll back protections for victims and who may insulate him and his family from enforcement,” said Corey Frayer, who recently left a post as a crypto adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission."

In the days before Mr. Trump was sworn in, Shawn M. Whitson, 40, of Walnut Cove, N.C., owner of a small computer repair business, had celebrated Mr. Trump’s return to the White House. “Today, we take our country back!” Mr. Whitson wrote, with a photo of Mr. Trump, on Inauguration Day. He also expressed hope that $Trump would rise in price.  But by the end of January, Mr. Whitson was fed up. “Done with this $Trump crap,” he wrote in a social media posting.  Mr. Whitson, reached by The Times on Friday expressed disappointment. “That coin is a joke.”  Over the past six months, President Trump and his sons have made a series of aggressive forays into the crypto industry. As Mr. Trump promoted crypto on the campaign trail, he also helped start a company called World Liberty Financial, which offered a digital currency called $WLFI to certain wealthy investors with experience in financial markets.  Last week, Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Mr. Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, announced that it was moving into the financial services industry by creating a brand known as TruthFi that will offer investment products tied to Bitcoin.  Trump Media’s chief executive, Devin Nunes, called the offerings “a competitive alternative to the woke funds and debanking problems that you find throughout the market.”  But the debut of the $Trump memecoin was the first time the Trump family had marketed a new crypto token directly to ordinary investors.  At the request of The Times, crypto experts reconstructed some of the early trades made by buyers of Mr. Trump’s token, examining their profit taking and how, once the initial buyers started to dump their holdings, the price of $Trump then crashed, hurting other investors.  The analysis of crypto transaction records was executed by the forensic firms Nansen and Chainalysis as well as by Molly White, an independent crypto researcher who is often critical of the industry. The data was then reviewed by The Times.  This pattern of big, fast buyers entering and then selling out of their memecoin holdings is part of the reason that state regulators in New York recently warned consumers about these offerings, saying that “creators or their associates artificially inflate the price of the coins and then sell their own coins rapidly at an inflated price, reaping substantial profits while causing the price to crash.”  New York regulators called these maneuvers “pump-and-dump schemes” and said they can leave buyers who come in late with big losses.  No evidence has emerged that Mr. Trump or his associates artificially inflated the coin’s price or engaged in insider trading. Asked about the early $Trump trades and profit taking, the president’s middle son, Eric Trump, declined to comment.  The Starting Gun  In the crypto world, every transaction is recorded on a publicly viewable ledger known as a blockchain. Typically, the names of the people making trades remain hidden, with each account identified only by a long chain of letters and numbers.  The blockchain allows crypto analysts to go back and look at new offerings and decipher what each wallet did — when it first invested, when it transferred any tokens or sold them off, and what the ultimate profit and loss turned out to be for every play. This analysis can also point to anomalies in trades that raise questions.  For example, blockchain records show that the $Trump token was “minted” at 9:01 a.m. Eastern time on Jan. 17, creating a so-called contract address. It was not announced by Mr. Trump for another 12 hours."

It had been filled that evening with virtual currencies, seemingly ready to pounce on a new offering.  The well-timed trades, and the fact that the wallet received its funding shortly before Mr. Trump’s coin launched, immediately drew skepticism from crypto analysts, who speculated that a trader had been acting on inside information.  In the crypto world, pinning down the person behind a trade is sometimes impossible. It is common for people to post big and sometimes unverifiable claims on social media before abruptly disappearing, making it difficult for amateur investors to distinguish legitimate investments from scams.  This month, an X account claiming to represent a Dubai-based crypto trader named Syed Sameer posted that he was the owner of one of the wallets that had orchestrated the first giant $Trump trade worth $1.1 million.  Mr. Sameer, who also claimed to be an investor in World Liberty Financial, was subsequently accused on X of using insider information to get in early on the $Trump token.  But the examination by The Times found inconsistencies in the claims on Mr. Sameer’s website and X account. After he was confronted with those issues, Mr. Sameer said in messages on the chat app Telegram that he did not actually control the wallet.  Mr. Sameer had lied about it “for clout, to be honest with you,” he said. “I know it’s stupid and childish but yeah, I was messing about.”  The Lucky 31  What is clear, based on blockchain records, is that the person behind that $1.1 million trade is a big player among the hordes of professional traders who rapidly buy up and then sell off new memecoins, trying to cash in on speculative surges as the coins are issued.  After making the purchase, the owner of the account then rapidly moved to sell the coins, generating a profit of at least $50 million, according to the analysis of the transaction by Aurelie Barthere of Nansen. Further sales brought the total profits to $109 million, according to the review by Ms. White.  Other large $Trump trades have also drawn attention, including one by a trader who started buying the coin about two minutes after it was launched. The trader then sold those $Trump tokens in less than a half an hour, with a net profit of $2.7 million, the blockchain shows.  Just under 700,000 wallets recorded gains on $Trump, the examination by Chainalysis shows. The early trades were some of the most profitable: 31 of these large early traders made $669 million in profits in a matter of days, according to the Nansen analysis.  But for every winner, there were even more losers.  Across the first 19 days of trading, a total of 813,294 wallets registered losses, either by cashing out at a loss or holding onto coins that had plummeted in value.  The losers — those who paid more for the token than it is now worth — cumulatively have lost $2 billion, in actual or paper losses. Still, many of these traders are holding on to their money-losing tokens, perhaps hopeful that the price will rise again, the data shows.  The profits mostly secured by the early buyers were enormous: a total of $6.6 billion in cashed-out profits, according to Chainalysis."

A few weeks before the $Trump launch, some of the same wallets that bought the president’s token also traded a memecoin called Hawk Tuah, promoted by the social media influencer Haliey Welch.  The Hawk Tuah coin surged in December after it was first introduced to a $490 million market capitalization, and then crashed to $10 million as of this week, leaving thousands of investors with losses and generating a lawsuit claiming it had “created a speculative frenzy” and violated federal law. (Ms. Welch said on X that she was “fully cooperating with and am committed to assisting the legal team representing the individuals impacted.”)  “This is similar to sports betting or gambling,” said Gareth Rhodes, a former deputy superintendent at the New York State Department of Financial Services, which helps regulate the crypto industry and other financial services companies. “The retail customer putting in their funds is doing so at risk of losing most if not all of it with the hope of an outsize payoff.”"

The coin's value initially rose, benefiting early investors, but later crashed. Despite the losses, no evidence suggests Trump or his associates manipulated the coin's price. Public Citizen has called for an investigation into potential violations of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause and other regulations, as the coin's sales could be seen as soliciting gifts rather than offering tangible products.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

But I personally would never buy anything launched by Trump, and I definitely would not buy a coin where somebody owned 80% of the coins! Look at the white paper. Look at the tokenomics before you buy."

Crypto, especially BTC, is not living up to the promises idealists envision for it because it's being hoarded by speculators. By virtue of its limited supply, such a state of affairs seems inevitable, actually.  I can imagine a solution where stored crypto evaporates over time, freeing up new supply for later mining. This would favor transactions. But any solution that erodes crypto as a store of value would cause big players to sell their holdings and devalue the coin, would it not? This would work against its greater adoption by the public. This makes me feel like crypto, as a limited coin, is doomed to fail as an alternative currency. Block chain a technology, might prove more useful.  How do you make a digital currency that is as transactionally useful as inflationary fiat money, while also being a rock-solid store of value divorced from the wild ups and downs of market gamblers?"

We have to live with this every day. I didn’t bother sending the link because these guys will not accept video evidence. I mean you should head their arguments about Jan 6th. So much video evidence and you still have mother fuckers calling it a peaceful protest or a day of love. Then they say well any violence committed was by ANTIFA. Which is a small group that you never hear anything about at all unless conservatives do something shitty then all of a sudden it’s ANTIFA! And how fucked is our society that suddenly a group that is against fascism is evil. My grand father was paid by the IS government to kill fascist. He got medals and ribbons for the shit. Now he would be a villain.

This shift aims to address policy issues like banking and Bitcoin mining while avoiding internal industry conflicts. The decision may be influenced by Ripple's lobbying efforts, which some insiders claim have pushed the administration away from including Ripple in government discussions. The summits are seen as a strategic move to gather expert input without forming a permanent council.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

You could look at the code base if you wanted to.... but no you just spout nonsense and show everyone you are happy being dead wrong.   The XRPL was built by ex BTC devs who saw the issues early on.  There are posts from Satoshi from the early days on BTCtalk forums regarding the XRPL and XRP in a positive light. Again you can go and see it direct from the source. But of course you wont. But you know more than Satoshi right?  One day you will realise you are wrong. Perhaps you will die before then perhaps not.   The only crypto coin to ever have a higher market cap than BTC on coin market cap is XRP. You going to tell me this is also not true right??

I do wonder how it's lasted over a decade with out anyone messing with the database or updating it directly. I would of thought one of these ripple scam artists would of just updated it and done a runner.  Anyone can run a node so why don't you spin one up and take the lot?

Due to the XRPL not needing a full history on every node but just the last ledger as its a complete set of all current balances they chose to just continue on to avoid disruption at that point. Bitcoin you need the full history to build out hte current state of all wallets. XRPL the next ledger contains the state of all wallets. Saves a lot of hdd space and makes it more efficient.   Are you thinking that there is something in the first 33000 blocks that has any impact on the next block?

The XRP ledger works differently with its consensus algorithm.  That is why its faster, cheaper, securer and way more energy efficient.   The XRPL has closed out more than 94million ledgers(blocks) BTC has closed out just under 900k blocks."

Do you also know that your XRP tokens are in fact worthless as they will be replaced with other tokens made by Ripple IF it will even be used on a big scale commercially ? You are not holding a share in the company, you are holding a token that only Ripple labs can mint and has full control over. Also, if you ever looked at the codebase you would have seen that there are so called Transaction Validators that need to validate all transactions, and even though you have a node, you need to use the Ripple Labs list of validators to validate every single transaction, this is not decentralized."

Both BTC and XRPL are just code running on servers. Both sets of code can be changed and ran. There is no difference between changing one set of code or the other. If enough people run the new code it is now the blockchain. This happens all the time with XRP, it has happened with BTC. Obviously it can happen again. Although it is a lot harder to do with BTC now. XRP on the other hand has mechanisms built into it that enables it to evolve. This is a huge plus for XRP over BTC.  Since the XRP ledgers creation how many XRP tokens have been replaced with new tokens? It is Zero, I guess XRP holders are going to be in for a shock when ripple replaces them.  Pretty sure XRP is worth something since I can sell it.  I am fully aware XRP does not give you a stake in ripple. No one thinks that. It is a bit like BTC doesn't give you a stake in MicroStrategy or the lightning network or Satoshi's horde or one of the BTC Mining pools.   Ripple has one Validator in the UNL. Anyone can chose their own UNL. There just has to be enough overlap between UNLs to obtain consensus. Again you are talking lies.  You BTCMaxis are classic, you talk nonsense non stop about something that isn't Bitcoin. Why not just not speak about XRP? instead you prefer to be wrong all the time. Given XRP is the 3rd ranking crypto by market cap you all are doing a terrible job at convincing people with your incorrect information. Why not just say nothing and stick with your BTC???"

Decentralized finance is one of the larger categories of blockchain development, offering a variety of services in an entirely new way.  Need a loan but don’t want to take one out from some potentially predatory, centralized company or bank? Aave serves that purpose, with checks in place to prevent (at least to some degree) irresponsible decisions if you can’t actually afford the loan (unlike many companies, who will give loans to people knowing they’re likely to get trapped in interest.  Want to buy, sell, and trade crypto without having to go through centralized exchanges, which all have some shenanigans and manipulative history (and should be trusted now less than ever)? Decentralized exchanges offer that service, including Uniswap  Some DeFi networks bridge the gap between the world of fiat with crypto, servicing individuals, businesses, banks, and federal agencies. There’s also decentralized marketplaces developing, offering alternatives to corporations.  Smart contract networks are at the core of the whole thing, developing the smart contracts by which cryptocurrency is governed. Ethereum is the leading example here and a primary player in the DeFi smart contract space, but it is slow and expensive compared to some other underdogs. I always liked Cardano because they leveraged actual peer-reviewed research, more so than any other coin I know of. Solana is another one, but is centralized and doesn’t give off fair-play vibes.  Litecoin is superior as a payment processing coin to most others, including the fees businesses can incur when customers pay by card. There’s a lot of reasons why Litecoin would be preferable for any company over fiat, although it would have to hold out and show more stability (like the rest of the market). Ripple (XRP) is another one, although centralized, may or may not be as untrustworthy as Solana.   Numerous coins support dApp development, including ETH, SOL, Polygon, NEAR Protocol, Avalanche (a favorite of mine, not because of the value of the coin or projected value, but because it brings real improvements to the table, showing scalability beyond ETH at some point.  Privacy coins for virtually untraceable transactions (plenty of legitimate reasons to want this, from individual use to the highest levels of corporations and governments. Most popular is Monero (XMR); others include Zcash, Dash, and Verge. I haven’t used or looked to deep into Verge but it does sound cool, implements several privacy technologies including the Tor network.  Other various services exist around data management, AI integration, Web3 development, and interoperability (connecting different blockchains).  Some of the most concrete examples for newbies or those who haven’t ever been interested enough to learn are within the dApp category, because we have analogous centralized apps. Take Spotify for example, and all the complaints of ripping off artists yet the artists can’t really leave because Spotify is so prevalent.  - Audius is a decentralized music streaming app, a bit more than a simple dApp, but from a users respective it serves same purpose. The benefit is that far more of your money goes directly to the artist (as least in theory, I have read of some not getting proper compensation - the compensation bit relating to DeFi).  - File storage projects include decentralized cloud storage (Storj, Filecoin, Siacoin); permanent data storage (Arweave), and decentralized file sharing (BitTorrent). I gave storj a shot and it’s pretty cool. Cheaper than current cloud storage options because you pay for only what you use, rather than upgrading to 1TB and only needing 300Gb of it.  - Brave browser allows users to set up a crypto wallet and earn Basic Attention Token (BAT) for watching adds, giving back some of that profit to the people.   - Helium (HNT) is an alternative to telecom providers like At&T and Verizon, offering token payments to users who set up hotspots that provide mobile services.  - Steemit (STEEM) is a blockchain powered alternative to Reddit  - Theta is decentralized YouTube.  - Civic offers identity verification, like how Google offers identity verification when you log into a 3rd party site using a Google account, without storing personal data in centralized servers.  - Render: decentralized GPU rendering  - Akash: decentralized cloud computing  - ocean protocol: decentralized data marketplace  - Golem: decentralized supercomputer computer, giving users access to much higher computing power  - Power Ledger: allows for buying and selling of energy, particularly electricity, such as selling excess electricity generated by your solar panels to a neighbor without having to go through an intermiediary.  - IOTA’s a bit dystopian sounding, not sure, but referred to as the Internet of things, where smart devices pay each other for services directly.  - Domain names (HNS), censorship-resistant domains (NMC), GPS/google maps replacements (HONEY), search engines, decentralized Wikipedia alt (IQ), Twitter alt (Mastodon), eBay (OGN), Facebook/Instagram (Mines, DESO), Twitch alt (Dlive, built on TRON), LinkedIn (IND), Kickstarter/GoFundMe alts (Giveth, Gitcoin, Fundirion), Uber/Lyft (Arcade City, DAV network, academic research (RSC, ERK, ORV, ARK, SCINET, Numex, DeSci), there’s just so many applications.  I’m a 5th grade STEM teacher, I’ve been using AI in various experimental ways across the range of tasks at my job. This upcoming break, I’d like to try using web3 data storage along with ChatGPT to fulfill a few functions. One, permanent storage using Arweave to give the GPT access to curricula. Two, flexibility for the GPT to access data that is continuously updated, collective and individual data that can be anonymized and privacy-protected, through Web3 applications. Eventually, I’d like to test a few options for both funding projects and monetizing original curricula and materials I’ve made and am making.   There are ways to fulfill these functions without crypto and web3 applications, and I’ve already been playing with those, but there is real value in some of these projects moving forward. Most are small right now, not expecting crowdfunding to be as successful on Giveth than DonorsChoose, but it’s fun to play with.  —-  While these various dApps (there’s much more than that) come and go, are highly volatile, face huge competition to corporations, and are far from perfect, hopefully I’ve given enough examples in this far too lengthy reply to exemplify the potential value of crypto as a means of decentralized services beyond traditional concepts of fiat.  On the flip side, crypto can be used as a surveillance system by billionaires to set up dystopian crypto-surveillance city-states that essentially operate as independent governments. So, that’s probably not good."

He believes the rug pullers story that it was all found in  legal public information and confirmed it himself.

Here it is  Good News / Bad News  GOOD: New exclusive Patreon content and director's commentary!   BAD: We had to scrap our upcoming episode of Coffeezilla about $TRUMP coin.  Here's what happened:   1. We identified a trader on $TRUMP coin who made $100 million sniping (buying early).   2. The wallet clearly had early intel based on their transaction history, we were convinced this was insider information.   3. At the last second before publication, we finally found the person behind it and interviewed them.   4. They denied insider intel and had an equally compelling explanation that they discovered the coin using public information.  While I'm not positive I believe them (plenty of reasons to lie about insider intel), the $TRUMP coin video was built around a premise that I now didn't have full confidence in, so I scrapped the episode even though 80% of the work had been done... leaving the team with a fun episode and nowhere to release it.   I thought I'd leave it here, to memorialize the work, add some director's commentary, explain what we've been up to, and say I think this is just part of the process with journalism.   Sometimes you start a story believing one thing, and end up believing another. If you're lucky, you'll figure all that out before you hit publish!   So even though it's sad to see the episode go into the dustbin, better that than seeing an episode go live that should've gone in the dustbin!   Credit to BUBBLEMAPS, who helped us with this story.

I mean, that is what everyone wants in the end of the day, to dump on someone when price is right but imagine a single entity having 5M BTC ready to unload at any given time to .. cut down their debt. This is something scary for any investor out there. Because if let's say USA gov manage to get 5M BTC and then in the long run Saylor, Blackrock and the rest of big institutes manage to have the other 25% - 5M BTC...  I mean ... wtf!  Do we trust Trump that much because i do not. And those memecoins made me even less confident this dude cares about BTC and not about the money he can make with BTC"

The asset that they have been single handedly collecting more of than any other institution on earth for the past few years.   They are now the defacto rulers of this new system.  How much BTC does Michael Saylor own again?  How much more would they own if they used 5T of the USD to purchase more?  Ruin the USD, the biggest competitor while simultaneously propping our asset up over it?   That’s called killing two birds with one stone.

Then the USA can default on its debt, effectively rug pulling the whole world. And USD doesn’t go to zero because it’s backed by Bitcoin. Then Trump can hold another Bretton Woods conference with all the major powers and renegotiate a new agreement wherein all fiat including USD is pegged to Bitcoin. USA doesn’t have to pay back the full amount it borrowed from China or the EU or the Saudis. Instead of in dollars, Trump can pay them back with a very small amount from the Bitcoin reserve which has now skyrocketed in price. Debt solved. The only problem is USD is no longer the world reserve currency and cost of borrowing is much higher, we can’t impose sanctions on anyone anymore, and we can’t run large trade deficits. No more cheap goods from Asia (say bye to Walmart and Dollar General). And no more S&P500 going up forever (global investment in US companies just dries up and shifts to other parts of the world)."

Ignore for one second all the other horrible consequences of this idea, and consider only paying off the national debt.  A country NEEDS debt. If you reduced the national debt to $0, T-bonds would no longer exist. EVERYONE has exposure to T-bonds...if their real return rate dropped to 0%, the U.S. economy and the entire world economy would grind to a halt. Debt is how we INVEST in our economy -- just like corporate debt. The rate of return on the U.S. Tbond sets the minimum return rate for every other investment vehicle in existence.  The sheer amount of Americans that don't understand this really simple economic principle absolutely baffles me. Like, fine, if you want to reduce the debt to where GDP is at to save a bit on interest payments, I can get behind that. But that's legit as low as it should probably go.  The ONLY way this makes any sense is if Saylor is trolling/goading Trump (who is next-level dumb) into completely destroying the U.S. dollar in the hopes that BTC will replace it and pump his bags. And if that's the play, what does it say about a man who would kill literally billions of people to become Elon Musk x10? 🤔"

Someone please explain this to me, because I've gotta be missing something. But isn't this very different from say, an individual being in debt and making overpayments on a loan?   Afaik, most of the debt is owed to individuals, or for individuals through 401k, pension funds etc. Being non American I don't fully understand all the intricacies of treasury bonds, but if someone has a bond maturing in however many years, can the government just pay it off before maturity? Why would anyone accept this, if they bought the bond with the goal of making a fixed rate of return for a fixed number of years?   Unless people mean to reduce government borrowing, so that the increase in debt slows down, hopefully more than the increase in GDP. This would definitely make sense. But everyone I see talking about this issue just says they want the government to pay off it's debt like it's following a Dave Ramsey plan."

What profit does he have for tax sheet ? ... negative 5b since the unrealised gains are factual as he borrows money against the worth that is perceived. That's 5b less of income that needed to be paid tax on. Let's says that figure is 2b of money saved by less tax. It maybe more or less, that's not important for hypothetical   If the company becomes more valuable later on it doesn't matter you can just rinse repeat the 1st step.  Secondly. These people don't have any money at all. They take out loans against their stocks portfolio worth. So that next year the tax is again at a loss because they just lost whatever they borrowed and made no income, the loan they received isn't classified as income.   Can you see the trend here ?   Every so often in 1 year they will pay some tax which they report to the media to make it known this guy paid some tax... people think he pays that tax every year. He doesn't."

First of, yes right wing parties are more popular, thats true, nonetheless our right wing parties do not get the majority and they are not as crazy crazy agressive as the reps right now. And their leaders are actually people who can form coherent sentences.  We have a complete different issue: China took over the exports for industriel goods 2018 and our economy struggles to adjust to this new reality.   We don't have 'core issues'. Our streets are save, we still have a lot less shooting and violence than the USA by big margins.  And we are 'shitting' ourselves because of Trump because we can't believe what we are seeing. The biggest economy and military power, the allies we had for decades, is throwing everything over board and is dismantling the biggest democracy on the planet. This is not shitting its frustrating to see.  this 'Experiment' you allow to happen either leads to a collapse of the USA as we have known it for decades OR it will be the last time you guys ever vote ever again.  Putin on the other hand is a lot less powerful than ever. We make weapons, a LOT, and very good ones. Europe is the biggest weapons exporter AFTER the USA. WE know how to do weapons.  WE don't want to know how to do weapons because WE are not war mongering, aggresive people. We are smart about things. Thats why WE were 'naive' enough to play with Putin before we started to accept the relatiy that even in 2025, there are still wars and this time on our doorstep.  The current USA Situation is potentially even better for EU than the USA. It strengthen our bonds, our proudness, it forces us to step up the Weapons game, which will be influx for our Economy and we unite against the new aggressor USA and the other aggressor Russia."

You know, basic corruption. Bribes and under the table payouts. Which has been happening for a long long time now with all the deregulation since the Clinton Administration & the Republican Congress under Newt Gingrich he cooperated with to achieve deregulation to help the growth of the internet and massive growth of the financial sector. The one saving grace is that many financial institutions and wealthy investors have skin in the crypto game. So they won't destroy it as long as part of their wealth is in it.

The left understands that wars in Syria make Syrian Refugees.    The left also understand that reactively putting hundreds of billions of dollars into military spending after saying that there was no money to be found for social welfare spending looks fucking bonkers to the average person with a modicum of intelligence. As well as the fact that it wasn't the left who was not building adequate infrastructure to accept migrants, but rather the centre-right.   Also, the migrant problem in Germany is actually a 20% issue for Germans for this election and is being inflated as an issue by right-wing media. The real issue is a floundering economy, mainly due to a war and energy crisis of America's making. Germany and France were both vehemently against inviting Ukraine into NATO."

How Naive is Saylor? Not going to say anything about DJT.  If this headline is true no one should place any further credence in anything Saylor has to say. He clearly has no real clue on how the debt/sweat equity enslavement of the fiat bankers really works. The National Debt is not owed to any nation...its owed to a group of Bankers themselves. They don't want to be repaid ever. They want a perpetual society of debt enslaved servitude guaranteeing them a pool of human capital to enrich themselves through inflationary monetary policy.  People speak about the national debt but neglect to identify those whom created the debt in the first place creating and claiming % that ensures that the principle will never ever be repaid and ensures that they claim a perpetual interest payment to maintain a privileged lifestyle. Pay off the National Debt..Saylor is a clown and this just proves it.

Most, if not virtually all of it, is sent through undersea and terrestrial fiber optic cables. These cables they connect all the countries and data centers all over the world and it all spreads and connects like a spider web. There’s not really, or at least there shouldn’t be, a single point of failure damage to which could bring down the whole network as it’s fairly decentralized on the transmission level and you have the few companies and Internet Service Providers hogging control over access and data centers. And there was the famous incident when a single grandma digging in her yard disconnected a whole country by breaking a fiber optics cable that was buried in her yard. The cable was the only thing connecting the country to the internet.   If this whole intricate system suddenly failed tomorrow, I think the world could crumble into chaos given how much our fragile financial system depends on it. The whole stock market is online now. All of banking, payment processing, credit cards, it’s all handled through the internet. The global supply chain, everything depends on it. Crypto would be the last thing peopled be worried about. I’m not sure how much gold or silver would be worth in the face of a global economic Armageddon like that, but I’m willing to bet not very much, as we’ve pushed ourselves away from the gold standard.   So going back to crypto, I wouldn’t worry about it being all on computers. As if the internet failed, the world would fail. However if Trump decided to pump and dump bitcoin as a solution to public debt, that’d be the real danger to crypto. People would lose faith in the system completely and it would collapse. In that scenario, your assets are surely safer in elements."

It can only do 7 TPS. That's a maximum of 604,800 per day. There have been days where BTC transactions were more than 500,000. A 1,000 increase in transaction volume would mean it needs to scale to 6,000-7,000 TPS. Nobody uses the Lightning Network.  But again, if you want a high value for BTC then you can't have a high volume of transactions. Why would you buy a coffee with BTC if it is a store of value?"

A reserve is not going to trade (sell) BTC for fiat. It’s one-way: the asset is acquired and it never leaves the cold wallets. Saylor is doing exactly that - MSTR is not selling.   Right or wrong, he believes that BTC is the new global currency. It would put the US in a tremendous position of economic strength to have 5M in a national reserve. If we don’t do it, other major countries will soon anyways. May as well be first and not play catch up with skyrocketing USD prices.  I am not a Trump fan at all. I hope he listens to Saylor and commits. Doesn’t have to be 5M, let’s start with 1M and see how things go."

Lightning is used mostly for niche applications like microtransactions, gaming, and remittances, but it hasn’t replaced traditional BTC transactions at scale. Daily LN volume is still a small fraction of total Bitcoin activity.  So while **Lightning theoretically boosts TPS**, Bitcoin's real-world transaction throughput remains largely limited to the **base layer's \~7 TPS** for most users."

With 4 links to different news agencies, and also a direct screenshot, all showing you and confirming to you that the X post is literally just lying.  No, DOGE did NOT ""always have it as 8M"". They listed 8B saved two days ago, then edited it after people noticed. Then lied on X claiming they never had it wrong.  > When you modify the xref you have to save and reload in the document that is linking the xref. Then the data is updated.  You don't need to update anything if you didn't fuck up in the first place, so why would that be relevant?  > Note that the DOGE website pulls from FPDS.

Do you know how big the EU is?  Putting Immigrants somewhere is something we do for a while now. You remember when Merkel opened the Doors for the refugies who were waiting at the EU Borders? I do because the Trains came through Munich and I worked close by it and you know what? If you didn't go there on purpose you didn't even see it.  And I still see them here because the Housing Solutions are still here. Is it a problem? Not in my daily life its not. Not at all.  Selling things to China yeah I do agree partially but lets be honest, China will take over as the country with the highest GDP in 2035 and has surpassed Germans industrial exports in 2018. Lets just be realistic: At the end of the day we are in a global world and a country as big as China and with lower wages and higher working ethics/more work pressure will success one way or the other. But i'm not owning a industrial company.  The biggest hurt in germany is our own ignorance: Instead of pushing together for a better renewable future and lower energy prices, the CDU stoped it in a time were it was super shitty to do so and when Habeck proposed the new Heating strategy (sure he might not have communicated it well enough) but it was just blunt ignorance. This ignorance made it harder for heat pump companies in germany again.  The other ignorance was/is my home state Bavaria: We crippled our renewable wind energy and didn't build out the east-south link. Conservatives again hurting us left and right.  The islam topic is just stupid and doesn't matter in germany at all. Its a typical right wing non relevant talking point. The amount of terrorism in Germany is so low that every single one of them goes through the whole press in our whole country because it happens so seldom.   I'm really not sure what your weapon commentary is, any source for this?  After all we do have character and stand up against Putin. A little bit slow but we have not had the routine and motivation to have wars and fighting. We are rich enough to keep NATO as is. We do not need the USA.  Nonetheless, my frustartion with Trump is not that we knew it might happen, but the blunt ignorance of Trump and the USA Citizens accepting that an long lasting friendship and allies now stab us in the back and the USA Citizen don't care enough."

The hash rate fluctuates but lets look at your 792 EH/s number.  [https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart)  Napkin calculation below:  The fastest ASIC miner can hash at 860 TH/s. 792 EH/s divided by 860 TH/s = 920,000  101% of 920,000 = +/- 929,200  Nvidia and AMD produce tens of millions of GPUs per year and those are a lot more complicated than an ASIC that only has to hash the BTC algorithm.  It might be feasible for an attacker to mass-produce ASIC rigs at around $10 per TH/s.  792 EH/s = 792 million TH/s.  101% of 792 EH/s = 800 EH/s = 800 million TH/s  800 million x $10 per TH/s = $8 billion  The Bitmain Antminer S21e XP Hyd 3U Bitcoin Miner 860TH/S can hash at 13 watts per TH/s and consumes 11,180 watts.   Assume the electrical power rate is 10 cents per kWh.  800,000,000×13 watts=10,400,000,000 watts  10,400,000 kW×24 hours=249,600,000 kWh per day  249,600,000 kWh×0.10=24,960,000 dollars per day  The total daily cost to operate **800 million TH/s** at **13 watts per TH/s** is **$24,960,000**.  The BTC market cap is around $2 trillion and can be attacked with around $10 billion if you add infrastructure, etc. This is why Justin Drake says the ratio is 200:1  It will cost a lot more to 51% attack Ethereum."

Even tho I’m pro crypto. We can’t deny that the scene is a shit show after what has transpired in the last year or so. This is why sensible regulation is needed and choke point clearly was misguided but I think well intended to protect consumers even if it was  both ineffective and misguided.

The current hashrate is close to 800M TH/s. An attacker would need close to 3 Million Bitmain Antminer S19 Pros.  You can’t just spin these up virtually or use quantum computing to shortcut. You have to have the physical ASICs powered up, cooled and running. That’s not trivial. Everyone will know the US is procuring ASICs with orders like that and massive new warehouses constructed and powered. Instead of a global monetary arms race of hoarding BTC, it would be a global ASICs production race. After a few months, now you need 5 Million ASICs to do the attack.   I suppose it’s possible to seize US-based mining companies’ mining hardware, but if you’re going that route, why not just seize Mstr and Coinbase and take the BTC? Way easier and more valuable.  The incentive structure of BTC, miners and nodes is designed to pit everyone else against you if you threaten the network, making the attack magnitudes more difficult.  Yes it’s probably theoretically possible to do this, but why would they? Similarly, it’s possible that the majority of the network could agree to increase the max supply to 100M BTC, change the block size, etc. but to do so would devastate the value of the BTC they all hold. So maybe some freaks would try, but good luck getting rational actors to agree. The incentives preclude things like this."

I understand that it most likely is a way for people to somewhat anonymously bribe the president. However, what does Trump's highly regarded supporters even think it is for?   For example, can you buy anything with it? Does it even pretend to be money like Bitcoin? At least with Bitcoin you can still use it to buy drugs and assassins and other stuff. What does your amount of TRUMP coins allow you to buy?   Or do these people genuinely think it is a sound investment and they will be the ones who become millionaires when TRUMP coin goes to the moon, and they will get out just in time while all the other suckers who invested, except for them, become broke and destitute? Then they can laugh at the poors from the Trump Tower even though they were just them?"

Plus, monero has higher TPS than bitcoin and it is more energy efficient. Sure you may have created the lightning network but bitcoin's waste of energy is still there and it's still only 7 TPS. That energy could go to something that is actually producing something of value. Monero at least provides privacy, but it's also much more energy efficient by its algorithm. It's also decentralized due to RandomX allowing anyone to mine with any CPU. This is very decentralized and allows almost anyone to mine.  Bitcoin would be great if it had a roadmap to stop all the energy waste. Instead, it has a conservative community of fools. Cryptos like ALGO do ridiculous amounts of TPS without requiring so much waste of energy, so I'm not sure why bitcoiners want to stay in the past? Even ethereum abandoned PoW. We might as well port bitcoin over to different blockchains and abandon that nonsense. Its value would be as a collectible."

"Michael Saylor urges Trump to buy 5M Bitcoin: ""We can generate $80T and pay off the national debt""",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1iukz6n/michael_saylor_urges_trump_to_buy_5m_bitcoin_we/,2025-02-21 07:02:39,3414,2025-02-23 21:26:03,1,">To [buy Twitter](http://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/tech/elon-musk-twitter-sale-agreement/index.html), Elon Musk just sold a ton of stock and made a boatload of money on the sale. But because of a US tax law quirk, Musk’s stock sale could give him an enormous tax break.  The crux of the article, and you're argument i assume.  >Musk last month sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares for more than 100 times what he paid for them (he exercised options and bought them for a massively reduced price). But the IRS doesn’t care what Musk initially paid for the stock; it cares only what the shares were worth when he bought and sold them.  That's right. It only cares what assets that trigger a capital gain event were worth when bought and sold.  If I buy a share for $100, and sell it for $120, i have made a capital gain of $20.  If I sold it instead for $80, i have made a capital loss of $20.  You don't pay tax on a loss, of course. It's a negative value. Nothing to see here.  >Tesla’s stock was going for more than $1,000 a share when Musk bought 22.9 million shares late last year, but by the time he sold the 9.6 million shares last week, the price had fallen, and he received only $883 a share, on average. That difference comes to about $1.7 billion.  Musk bought shares for $1,000 a pop, and sold them for $883 a pop.  A capital loss. A negative value.  > In the eyes of the IRS, the sale could count as a massive tax loss that would reduce Musk’s future taxes by between $400 million and $700 million.  It's not ""could count"", it does count. It's super basic maths. $1,000-$883= -$117.  >It may sound like cheating, but it’s legal – and a common practice for wealthy investors.  It doesn't sound like cheating. It's not a ""common practise"". It's basic maths. Negative numbers are numbers that are less than zero. Grade school maths.  A person's income for the financial year is everything they earned, such as salary and sale of assets/capital gains, minus everything they lost. In this case a capital loss of 9,600,000 * -$117= $1.123 billion (i don't know how they calculated $1.7 billion above).  Let me ask you: If you bought $10,000 worth of shares and sold them a few months later for $8,000, what is your taxable income on this trade?"

So we agree then.  >It may sound like cheating, but it’s legal – and a common practice for wealthy investors.  Does it sounds like cheating? Anyone can do the same. It's not exclusive to wealthy investors or anything.  It's just basic maths; sum of all profits minus losses and expenses = taxable income.  Now, there is no advantage to making a loss. Ever. Of course. There is no person or company that actually aims to make a loss.  You can deduct your loss from your taxable income, but because tax is never 100% you'll never get 100% of it back.  \---  In the article there Mr. Musk exercised his share options, which became his salary. Let's say for illustrative purposes that became $100 of shares.  He now has $100 worth of shares. You can't buy groceries with shares. However you can buy companies with shares, but I guess they didn't want to accept Tesla shares for Twitter and wanted cash.  So, Mr Musk has to sell his shares to convert them to cash, which is a taxable event as he has disposed of the asset.  He can only get $80 for them.  Therefore his income for the year is +100 in capital gains, -20 in capital losses = 80.  I'm sure if someone gave you $100 in shares for your salary, and you could only sell them for $80, you wouldn't expect to have a taxable income of $100, either.  That's all that is going on here. Just basic maths. There is no magic trick the wealthy use or anything. Anyone can do this, and you do for any deduction you claim."

The first major guidance on cryptocurrency taxation came from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2014 under the Obama administration. The IRS classified cryptocurrencies as property, making them subject to capital gains taxes under existing tax laws. However, this was not a new law but rather an interpretation of existing tax codes.  The first legislation explicitly addressing cryptocurrency taxation came under the Trump administration with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This law eliminated the ability to use like-kind exchanges (1031 exchanges) for cryptocurrencies, meaning that crypto trades became taxable events rather than being deferred like real estate transactions.  So while Obama’s IRS issued the first formal tax guidance on crypto, Trump’s tax reform law was the first major legislative change that directly impacted cryptocurrency taxation.  Recent reports suggest that the Trump administration is considering proposals to eliminate capital gains taxes on U.S.-issued cryptocurrencies, aiming to position the United States as a global hub for digital assets."

The tariffs, initially paused, are set to resume, sparking fears of a trade war and further market declines.

Centralized power structures will never support true decentralization and they will keep attacking it until they eventually self-destruct. Anyone believes that a puppet US president will support decentralized ecosystems has to be a fool and needs a reality check.

Doge, abandoning Europe/Nato, creating chaos at home, all play a role. But you asked specifically about tariffs and crypto, so here goes:  The entire world economy depends on there being a liquid supply of dollars since it is the world reserve currency and what most people borrow in. When that liquidity dries up, the real value of debt goes up causing people to get liquidated. Those who aren't already liquidated begin to sell their assets in order to pay off their debts before it gets worse, which causes a vicious cycle because the more people who start to pay off their debts defensively, the more dollars exit the system which further dries up liquidity, eventually culminating in a full scale panic and a market crash. The last time this happened was at the beginning of the COVID crisis. It was stopped by the Fed injected liquidity back into the system (money printing) which started a bull market in assets and created inflation.  What does this have to do with tariffs? It is because the primary way the US provides dollar liquidity into the global economy is by running trade deficits. In other words, by buying more stuff than it sells, the US injects dollars into the world economy which provides liquidity. You can think about it like if you buy more stuff than you're earning from your income, you need to use the credit card to do so, and by using the credit card you are putting more money into other people's pockets than you are taking out of other people's pockets. In the same way, by spending more money than it earns, the US is putting in net more dollars into the world which provides liquidity.   And here's the point: tariffs are designed to reduce the trade deficit. In other words, they are a way of trying to make it so that the US no longer spends more than it earns. This dries up global liquidity and will create a financial crisis, for the reasons I explained. Since crypto is a high risk and very liquid asset, it's one of, if not the first places that a liquidity crunch shows up, followed by stocks."

Remember when his casino was failing his dad went in and purchased a million in chips he just didn’t cash in. A way to circumvent accounting and put black ink on the books.   He has no problem using the systems available to him to make illicit transactions. However in his defense most of this is practically legal or a civil offense at best. We have seen him navigate and defeat criminal liability in most cases. Takes money to make money. When the rich run the government, they design it to keep them rich."
