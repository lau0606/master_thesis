The scheme so simple. Trick people into thinking this worthless digital rock is a currency and investment vehicle, base the transactional fee structure to the price of the rock so that the sellers are less inclined to sell or trade off the rock, and watch the price rise as supply drops. It's genius when you think about it. It's like a pyramid scheme. And no you probably don't want to buy your groceries with it because it will be cheaper to use your Visa or Amex due to the large fee you may have to pay when you sell. OOPS it may only be useful for purchasing a car or house then, but oh you may have to pay taxes as either short or long term capital gains or ordinary income depending on how you acquired it. Meanwhile the people sticking with real cash, debit, and credit cards are not paying taxes or high fees to use their purchasing power. I guess it's not much of a currency at all or else everyone would already be using it. And it doesn't produce profit like a stock share either so how is the price rising? Supply and demand of course, but its just a silly branded rock that people keep in their pockets to feel like they are smarter than everybody else who purchased the other branded rocks. But boy does it feel good having that rock in your pocket. After all you don't want to be the only person who doesn't have a rock in their pocket even if it is just eye candy. And people say it will be worth millions or I can make a lot of money just by having this rock in my pocket! Yeah everyone crypto is a money laundering legal for now pyramid scheme that is used by international crime organizations that partake in human trafficking, sale and distribution of drugs, murder for hire, and all the bad shit. The government may one day freeze all your crypto if it ever gets directly tied to anything they don't want funded, so gamble while you still can, if you still want to. If the infomation above wasn't enough to convince you maybe this last bit will. Cryptocurrency is too violatile to be a currency or long term investment option, so good luck paying short term capital gains if you trade.",economicCollapse

It's just not traditional paid advertising, more word of mouth and new age advertising which most laypeople do not really understand. Advertising in the internet age is more akin to propaganda in the way it's created and distributed. And the vast majority of advertising is not quite individualized, but definitely targeted based on interest/engagement so what advertisements people see can be substantially different.   I do my best to block all advertising, data collection, and tracking so I don't see many ads and they're typically outside of my areas of interest, but the vast majority of people don't do that so they're seeing targeted advertising constantly. Conservatives are absolutely more likely to see content like this though which I think was your main point. And I absolutely agree that you don't have to be intelligent or financially literate to buy bullshit online.   Although I will say that I think more investment is coming from crypto bros who are just trying to guess right without caring who else benefits and semi-legalized bribery/money laundering than MAGA zealots who'll religiously waste their money on Trump's bullshit. I mean look at how people like Tom MacDonald target conservatives for pandering bullshit that's so obvious it should be cringe inducing and off-putting and insulting, but they get views from those they're pandering to as well as from the people who hate-watch that kind of nonsense. This isn't isolated to conservatives obviously, this has become a pervasive part of society, but I just don't understand how people buy into Trump being sent from god to save the American working class while he constantly says shit on live television that completely contradicts this view. They don't just vote for the guy against their own interests, but go to prison for him and waste what little money they have on bullshit he hocks which I'll never understand.",economicCollapse

In doing so, we can break free from the cycles of deception and division, envisioning a future grounded in truth, equity, and genuine peaceful co-operation.  If you haven't read Mark Fisher's work, it might resonate with you. What you said above reminded me of this quote from Capitalist Realism:  ""Emancipatory politics must always destroy the appearance of a ‚Äònatural order‚Äô, must reveal what is presented as necessary and inevitable to be a mere contingency, just as it must make what was previously deemed to be impossible seem attainable.‚Äù   ‚Äï Mark Fisher",economicCollapse

We are in the middle  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot  people should read more into it of course. There is a great book about it here:¬†https://jonathanmkatz.com/gangsters¬†Please don't buy anything from Amazon  For some background, Roosevelt was the candidate that was going to bring us out of the Gilded Age which, obviously, was unsustainable and crashed after two world wars, pandemics, a Wall Street crash, and an economic depression.  Smedley Butler was a famous anticapitalist Marine General that wrote ""War is a Racket"" and everyone should read it. Butler was the one who first identified the Military Industrial Complex. As a veteran myself, he has always been a hero to me and most veterans I knew, from my generation at least.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Is_a_Racket  Essentially, businessmen, (including JP Morgan) attempted to recruit a Marine Corps General who was incredibly popular, hated capitalism, and supported Roosevelt to be part of a coup. The General promptly did his civic and military duty and sounded the alarm to begin investigations.  These businessmen were planning to use Butler as the leader of the ""White House Putsch"" due to his popularity and thought he could be installed as a fascist leader with the support of veterans. Well, they didn't count on General Butler, even being a Republican, actually having a set of testicles that aren't stored at Mar a Lardo.  The conspirators were going to use the President's ""failing health"" as the main reason for the takeover when in reality, it was due to the plans to tackle extreme wealth inequality and needed infrastructure from FDRs ""The New Deal"". FDR was labelled a communist and socialist and was accused of reckless spending and conservatives didn't like that.  Of course, nothing really happened to any of them and we let them plan it again.  My issue is that this time, the similarities line up really well except the Military leaders (except for the traitor ex general Flynn) hate Trump. I kind of think that the techbros used Trump as their ""Smedley Butler"" instead.  My one hope is that you cannot have Technokings and a Fascist dictator. At some point, Trump is going to amass enough power to take on Musk and then I don't know who will win.  Putin took over Russia by controlling the country's oligarchs. He did this by jailing and killing any that step out of line and seizing their wealth.  https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/03/29/1088886554/how-putin-conquered-russias-oligarchy  However, the techno fascism route seems to be taking place at the same time.  https://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no?si=mNRO-So8mcDNDUBm  Right now, I don't know which would be better or worse or which is truly happening, but maybe we can make them collapse on each other or something.",economicCollapse

It‚Äôs funny‚Ä¶.. they are really scared to lose their way of governance.  Signs of a ‚ÄúDeath Grasp‚Äù for the Progressive State: 	1.	Recognition of Neoliberal Dominance: 	‚Ä¢	The post laments the destruction of New Deal and Great Society programs‚Äîwhich were the foundation of the progressive state in the U.S. 	‚Ä¢	It highlights how both parties embraced neoliberalism (deregulation, privatization, corporate control) from Reagan onward, with Clinton and Obama continuing that trend. 	‚Ä¢	Progressive policies are no longer the default. The U.S. has shifted decisively rightward on economic policy. 	2.	A Defensive, Almost Doomerist Tone: 	‚Ä¢	The post presents progressivism as a lost cause, where corporate power and reactionary politics have won. 	‚Ä¢	It frames the situation as irreversible, claiming the system was designed to fail, and that the U.S. is collapsing like Rome or the Eastern Bloc. 	‚Ä¢	The argument that mass media and PR have made the public too exhausted and misinformed to fight back implies a resignation to defeat. 	3.	The Collapse of Progressive Policy Achievements: 	‚Ä¢	Union membership has plummeted. 	‚Ä¢	Public education and literacy are allegedly in decline. 	‚Ä¢	Economic inequality is rising, with wealth redistribution now flowing upward, rather than downward as progressives intended. 	‚Ä¢	The courts (stacked with Federalist Society judges) have gutted progressive legal gains, including Roe v. Wade. 	‚Ä¢	Progressives no longer control the Democratic Party‚Äîit‚Äôs run by centrist neoliberals. 	4.	A Last Attempt to Persuade the Public: 	‚Ä¢	The call to ‚Äúread the Declaration of Independence‚Äù and ‚Äúbecome a nerd‚Äù is a desperate plea for civic engagement. 	‚Ä¢	There‚Äôs an anti-hero worship stance‚Äîcriticizing the reliance on charismatic leaders, which suggests a belief that bottom-up grassroots change is the only hope. 	‚Ä¢	The mention of historical manipulation, corporate ownership of media, and psychological operations suggests that progressivism failed not because it was wrong, but because the public was manipulated against it.  What This Means: 	‚Ä¢	This is not a victorious progressive argument; it‚Äôs a defense against defeat. 	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs an acknowledgment that the progressive project‚Äîbuilt through the 20th century‚Äîis being actively dismantled. 	‚Ä¢	It presents the progressive state as a victim of corporate and right-wing power, rather than as an inevitable force of history.  In many ways, this parallels the reactionary fear of ‚ÄúAmerican decline‚Äù on the right‚Äîexcept instead of blaming ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù or immigration, it blames neoliberalism and corporate power.",economicCollapse

You have no reason to suspect that. Even if it were true, and I doubt it, age is immaterial. Why would anyone assume that is beyond me. It's a bit of a non sequitur.

They did not come to get away from, but to create their own monoreligious state. Jamestown had nothing to do with religious anything.  The founding fathers were more worried about the religious causes of the wars of Reformation, eg the Thirty Years War, or the English Civil War; or things like the Inquisition; than anything like fear of something akin to escaping Christian nationalism.   There was no ""plan"" for the English colonies to become what they became. And the first amendment was supposed to prevent theocratic aspirations or religious repression.

Job growth under trump was much lower than it was under Obama even if you eliminate the covid year.  The mismanagement of the covid pandemic by that fucking orange putin ball licker is unforgivable, period full fucking stop.   trump had everything he needed to stop the pandemic left for him by the Obama administration and he choked. He lied and just couldn‚Äôt bring himself to do the right thing to get the pandemic under control. Instead the pandemic raged for years, while he talked about using a light to do a cleaning inside our bodies and promoted ivermectin. WTF? Absolutely inexcusable.   trump is responsible for every single covid death because he is the one who downplayed the severity of the virus and lied to the American people about the vaccine. But you don‚Äôt care about the 1 million Americans lost to trump‚Äôs incompetence because his employment numbers were ok.   And by the way the GDP under trump was FAR lower than under Biden, (t: 2.6% B: 3.26, excluding trump‚Äôs covid year) so let‚Äôs cut the bullshit about the unemployment rate. GDP is the truest measure of economic output. Further demonstration of his economic inferiority, trump ruined the soybean market for farmers with his tariffs, which the American people paid. Following the collapse of that market and the loss of 300,000 jobs as a result, farmers then had to be bailed out to the tune of $82 billion which the taxpayers also paid. Complete lunacy.  Clearly trump doesn‚Äôt understand the money supply or tariffs like the Wall Street Journal pointed out last week.

Job Growth: 	‚Ä¢	President Barack Obama (2009‚Äì2013): 	‚Ä¢	Context: Inherited the Great Recession, one of the most severe economic downturns in U.S. history. 	‚Ä¢	Employment Change: From January 2009 to January 2013, nonfarm employment increased from approximately 133.6 million to 135.9 million, a net gain of about 2.3 million jobs.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Average Monthly Job Growth: Approximately 48,000 jobs per month over the four-year period. 	‚Ä¢	President Donald Trump (2017‚Äì2021): 	‚Ä¢	Context: Assumed office during a period of economic expansion. 	‚Ä¢	Employment Change: From January 2017 to January 2021, nonfarm employment decreased from approximately 145.6 million to 142.6 million, a net loss of about 3 million jobs, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äôs impact in 2020.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Average Monthly Job Growth: Excluding the pandemic year (January 2017 to December 2019), the economy added approximately 6.6 million jobs over 36 months, averaging about 183,000 jobs per month.  Unemployment Rate: 	‚Ä¢	President Barack Obama: 	‚Ä¢	January 2009: 7.8% 	‚Ä¢	January 2013: 7.9% 	‚Ä¢	Peak: 10.0% in October 2009  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	President Donald Trump: 	‚Ä¢	January 2017: 4.7% 	‚Ä¢	January 2021: 6.3% 	‚Ä¢	Lowest Point: 3.5% in February 2020, before the pandemic‚Äôs effects  Ôøº  Economic Context and Challenges: 	‚Ä¢	Obama‚Äôs First Term: 	‚Ä¢	Great Recession Response: Faced with a contracting economy, significant job losses, and a financial crisis. 	‚Ä¢	Recovery Measures: Implemented the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to stimulate economic growth. 	‚Ä¢	Job Market Impact: While the unemployment rate peaked in 2009, gradual recovery led to consistent job growth starting in 2010. 	‚Ä¢	Trump‚Äôs First Term: 	‚Ä¢	Initial Economic Expansion: Inherited a growing economy with low unemployment rates. 	‚Ä¢	Pandemic Impact: The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to unprecedented job losses and economic contraction. 	‚Ä¢	Policy Responses: Enacted measures like the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to mitigate economic fallout.  Conclusion:  Both administrations faced unique economic landscapes. President Obama‚Äôs first term was marked by efforts to recover from a deep recession, resulting in modest job growth and a high unemployment rate that gradually decreased. In contrast, President Trump‚Äôs term experienced robust job growth initially, followed by significant losses due to the pandemic‚Äôs impact. When excluding the pandemic period, job growth under Trump was stronger in terms of average monthly gains compared to Obama‚Äôs first term. However, the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 crisis makes direct comparisons complex.

Neither administration fully met the expectations of effectively managing the pandemic.  Trump Administration: 	‚Ä¢	Early Response: The initial handling was marked by delays in testing and inconsistent public health messaging. A Senate report highlighted ‚Äúsystemic problems‚Äù that hindered the early response efforts.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Political Interference: There were instances where political considerations influenced public health decisions, leading to a lack of coordinated federal response.  Ôøº  Biden Administration: 	‚Ä¢	Vaccine Rollout: Upon taking office, the administration prioritized vaccine distribution. However, challenges persisted, including vaccine hesitancy and logistical issues.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Mandates and Public Reception: Efforts to implement mask and vaccine mandates faced political and public resistance, complicating nationwide public health strategies.  Democratic Acknowledgment of Failures:  While there have been critiques of the Trump administration‚Äôs handling of the pandemic, it‚Äôs important to note that Democratic leaders have also faced scrutiny. For instance, a House panel criticized former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs management of nursing home COVID-19 data, indicating that failures were not exclusive to one party.

Let‚Äôs examine each aspect based on available data:   1. GDP Growth Comparison: 	‚Ä¢	President Donald Trump (2017‚Äì2021): 	‚Ä¢	Average Annual GDP Growth: Approximately 2.3%.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Excluding 2020 (COVID-19 Impact): Focusing on the first three years (2017‚Äì2019), the annualized real GDP growth rate was about 2.58%.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	President Joe Biden (2021‚Äì2025): 	‚Ä¢	Average Annual GDP Growth: Approximately 3.2%.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	First Three Years (2021‚Äì2023): The annualized real GDP growth rate was about 2.59%.  Ôøº  These figures indicate that, when excluding the pandemic-affected year of 2020, GDP growth under both administrations was relatively similar, with a slight edge to President Biden.  2. Impact of Tariffs on the Soybean Market: 	‚Ä¢	Tariffs and Export Decline: In 2018, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, leading to retaliatory tariffs from China on U.S. agricultural products, notably soybeans. This resulted in a significant decline in U.S. soybean exports to China.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Financial Aid to Farmers: To mitigate the impact on farmers, the U.S. government introduced aid programs. Direct farm aid increased from $11.5 billion in 2017 to over $32 billion in 2020, marking an all-time high.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Tariff Revenue and Aid Distribution: Notably, over 92% of the revenue generated from tariffs on Chinese goods was allocated to support farmers affected by these trade policies.  Ôøº  Conclusion:  While GDP growth rates under Presidents Trump and Biden were comparable when excluding the pandemic year, the trade policies during the Trump administration led to significant disruptions in the agricultural sector, particularly for soybean farmers. The financial aid provided to offset these challenges was substantial, highlighting the complex interplay between trade policies and domestic economic support measures.

Let‚Äôs examine this claim based on available information.  1. Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Perspective on Trump‚Äôs Tariff Policies:  The Wall Street Journal has critiqued Trump‚Äôs approach to tariffs, particularly highlighting the contradictory nature of his policies. In an article published two weeks ago, the Journal noted that while Trump favored implementing tariffs, he simultaneously desired a weaker dollar to promote U.S. exports. These two objectives can be at odds, as imposing tariffs can lead to a stronger dollar, making exports less competitive. The article stated:  	‚ÄúMr. Trump likes tariffs and wants more of them, but he also wants a weaker dollar to promote U.S. exports, and the two desires are in conflict.‚Äù  Ôøº  This critique suggests a potential inconsistency in understanding the interplay between trade policies and currency valuation.  2. Economic Implications of Tariffs:  Analyses have indicated that the tariffs implemented during Trump‚Äôs tenure had several economic repercussions: 	‚Ä¢	Impact on Inflation: A 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico was projected to increase the inflation rate to approximately 3.2%, surpassing the Federal Reserve‚Äôs 2% target.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Trade Relations and Manufacturing: The tariffs led to strained trade relations and had mixed effects on domestic manufacturing. While some industries saw protective benefits, others faced increased production costs due to higher prices for imported materials.  Ôøº  3. Understanding of Monetary Policy:  Regarding monetary policy, reports have highlighted proposals associated with Trump‚Äôs economic plans that could impact the Federal Reserve‚Äôs independence and influence inflation: 	‚Ä¢	Federal Reserve Independence: Plans were reported to potentially limit the Federal Reserve‚Äôs independence, including allowing the president to directly set interest rates and subjecting the Fed to oversight from the Office of Management and Budget.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Inflation Concerns: In June 2024, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists signed an open letter expressing concerns that Trump‚Äôs fiscal and trade policies, coupled with efforts to limit the Federal Reserve‚Äôs independence, could reignite inflation in the United States.  Ôøº  Conclusion:  The Wall Street Journal and other reputable sources have critiqued aspects of former President Trump‚Äôs understanding and implementation of tariffs and monetary policy. These critiques highlight potential inconsistencies and concerns regarding the economic implications of his policies.   President Donald Trump has frequently utilized tariffs as a political instrument to advance various policy objectives, including trade negotiations, immigration control, and national security. While tariffs can serve as a tool to protect domestic industries and address trade imbalances, their effectiveness and broader economic impact are subjects of ongoing debate.  Use of Tariffs as a Political Tool: 	‚Ä¢	Trade Negotiations: The Trump administration employed tariffs to renegotiate trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), aiming to secure more favorable terms for the U.S. However, critics argue that such tactics can strain diplomatic relations and lead to retaliatory measures.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Immigration Control: Tariffs have been used to influence immigration policies of neighboring countries. For instance, threats of tariffs on Mexican imports were utilized to pressure Mexico into enhancing its border security measures. While this approach yielded some concessions, its long-term efficacy and ethical implications remain contentious.  Ôøº  Economic Implications: 	‚Ä¢	Domestic Impact: While tariffs aim to protect domestic industries, they can also lead to increased production costs and consumer prices. For example, tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have been criticized for potentially harming industries that rely on these materials.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Global Trade Relations: The imposition of tariffs can trigger trade disputes and retaliatory tariffs from other nations, potentially leading to trade wars that disrupt global supply chains and economic stability.  Ôøº  Conclusion:  While President Trump‚Äôs use of tariffs as a political tool has achieved certain policy objectives, it has also introduced economic challenges and geopolitical tensions. The strategic application of tariffs requires careful consideration of both domestic benefits and potential international repercussions.   In the end we will be better in 4 years after Trump than we were 4 years after Biden!",economicCollapse

Hence why he will get far more of his agenda done than progressives since the 1930. He will dismantle your crown jewel in 4 years. You will never recover once he kicks over your sand castle.   Your points are progressive and not the truth, they are propaganda. Which is showed you. You guys mislead every chance you get.   Because the point was idiotic.  Progressives deal in the short term never looking for long term solutions. You all just worry about today and never the consequences of tomorrow  The argument for long-term benefits of Trump‚Äôs tariffs for American farmers is based on the idea that short-term pain leads to long-term gain by rebalancing trade relationships, reducing reliance on adversarial nations, and fostering domestic agricultural strength. Here‚Äôs how:  1. Reduced Dependence on China & Market Diversification 	‚Ä¢	Before the tariffs, China was the dominant buyer of U.S. soybeans and other agricultural goods, creating an unhealthy dependency. 	‚Ä¢	The tariffs forced U.S. farmers to explore new markets like Mexico, Egypt, and the European Union, which could provide more stable long-term trade relationships. 	‚Ä¢	Over time, this strengthens American agricultural independence and reduces vulnerability to Chinese economic retaliation.  2. Strengthened Domestic Agricultural Industry 	‚Ä¢	Tariffs encouraged investment in U.S. food processing, storage, and export infrastructure, making American farmers more competitive globally. 	‚Ä¢	The government‚Äôs financial aid during the tariff war helped farmers modernize equipment, improve efficiency, and adapt to changing trade dynamics. 	‚Ä¢	Over time, these improvements boost domestic production capacity, allowing farmers to be more competitive in global markets.  3. USMCA (NAFTA Replacement) & Fairer Trade Agreements 	‚Ä¢	The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiated under Trump expanded market access for American dairy, wheat, and poultry farmers in Canada. 	‚Ä¢	Stronger protections against unfair trade practices from Canada and Mexico helped stabilize North American trade for the long term.  4. Leverage for Future Trade Deals 	‚Ä¢	The tariffs gave the U.S. leverage to renegotiate trade deals from a position of strength. 	‚Ä¢	The Phase One Trade Deal with China (2020) resulted in China committing to purchase $200 billion in additional U.S. goods, including agriculture products. 	‚Ä¢	If future administrations maintain this pressure, China and other nations will be less likely to exploit American farmers through unfair trade practices.  5. Protection Against Foreign Agricultural Dumping 	‚Ä¢	Tariffs prevented China and other nations from flooding the U.S. market with artificially cheap agricultural products, which would have undercut American farmers. 	‚Ä¢	Over time, this ensures a fairer playing field for U.S. farmers, allowing them to compete on quality rather than just price.  Final Verdict: 	‚Ä¢	Short-term pain? Yes‚Äîfarmers suffered losses, and government bailouts were needed. 	‚Ä¢	Long-term gain? Likely‚Äîdiversification, infrastructure investment, better trade deals, and reduced reliance on China could position American farmers for stronger and more sustainable success.

By the way, this is technical bullshit - a lie that demands compliance even though no one, especially the liar, actually believes.  Loyalty and faith are typical demands to make bullshit function. It's a hallmark of bullshit & cult-type charismatic leaders, especially of the authoritarian flavor, to press for it and idealize it. What is the function of ""loyalty"" to the telegraph, the horse drawn carriage, or Blockbuster Video? Loyalty is only a virtue when the thing, but more importantly person(s) who are themselves virtuous. The current administration is quickly turning itself into a junta. This is always bad. But too much direct confrontation isn't productive.  The best way to deal personally with this is mutual aid within your local community.  Grow fruits & veggies at home. In your yard, on a fire escape, in a window sill. Then share and trade with neighbors.  Upcycle whatever you can. It reduces corporate revenue, increases personal liquidity, helps the environment, and can be a fun art & craft activity. It can be eventually community based.  Meet your neighbors. Talk to them about everyday things.  If someone is on hard times, and there will be many: layoffs are already happening; just go cut their grass. Invite them to dinner - let them help/bring something, rotate watching kids in the neighborhood, plan community based events - many municipalities allow for block parties (holidays, big dates like anniversaries/birthdays, local arts & craft events, etc); learn a new skill & offer it up cheap or free to your neighbors, eg learn to fix wifi, handyman skills, sewing/mending.  Learn to can, preserve, & ferment food. The average American tosses 35% of their food away annually, and food costs are still rising. This can be a skill you share.  Share books, ideas, information. At something like a cocktail/dinner party.  Donate what you can.  Shop local small businesses first. If you're growing food, canning, sharing, mending, fixing, you're saving money. If the local shop is more expensive, you have more to spend there. When you need things from chains, buy in bulk, and pool with neighbors. You and a neighbor(s) split the cost and buy once. Cuts corporate revenue and your costs. Increases community solidarity.  Many states now allow ""cottage industries"". Look up what they are. Start one. Support locals. Like that popup taco tent on your corner.   Ride public transport. Use ride share/carpool. Ride your bike. Avoid Uber/Lyft. Only buy used cars.  Shop at OfferUp, eBay, etc. for used items. Buy from individuals, not companies who exploit the site. Offer to give away or seek your stuff to your community first.  Celebrate ""Buy Nothing Day"".  Avoid direct conversations about politics & religion as much as possible. It used to be considered bad taste to discuss such things in mixed company. The best way to convince someone to change their beliefs, which are largely emotional is by the person knowing someone who is affected by whatever the issue is will more likely compell a change.  Know your shit. Going off half-cocked is a surefire way to shitcan any influence & cause the other to double down.  Consume small content creators on YouTube. Watch the actual ads... Maybe by letting a channel auto play while you're out running errands. The creator gets paid bc the algorithm only knows the video is playing, not that you're miles away.  Shop local farmer's markets.  Attend and support local high school & community college arts events, plays, sports, etc.  Meditate.  Exercise. Especially go for regular walks in your neighborhood and say ""Hi,"" to your neighbors.  Use the public libraries. Get a guest library card to a local college.  Read widely. Not just nonfiction, but fiction and poetry.  Go watch local music.  Take naps.  Learn a new language   Actually take your annual sick days, personal days, as vacation.  Say no to being on call for work after work hours. If you must, inform your boss it is illegal to not pay you for being on call.   Learn first aid & CPR. Donate blood.  Go to local district meetings: school board, water district, etc. public hearing for zoning and alcohol license changes. City council meetings. County board of supervisor meetings.  Vote   Push for voting reforms like ranked choice. Go to local party council meetings. If you have enough you get to set local party platforms and planks... If you want to try and change the major parties.  Serve on a jury. Learn what jury nullification is.  Fight parking tickets and low level traffic tickets by always demanding a jury trial. It is your seventh amendment right for all civil actions over $20. It's a right just like the 1st, 2nd, etc. and learn the rest of your legal rights.  Don't talk to the cops unless compelled to. No warrantless searches, no information given unless you have a legal requirement to do so, full stop.   Vote 3rd party whenever you can. Vote against corporate interests. This means against corporate tax cuts, estate tax cuts, capital gains taxes cuts,  income tax cuts for those making over $3 million/year. So if a candidate supports these, or not raising these, always vote against them. Vote to keep private home property taxes low. Vote to increase commercial property taxes. You'd be shocked how little country clubs pay in property taxes. Or how little Disneyland pays. Or private stadia & arenas.  Volunteer. Anywhere.  Attend a local protest, especially just to watch. Even if you don't agree.  That's just some. You don't have to do all. You can ramp up how many you do. It doesn't matter who is providing the top-down reform, it's still centrally controlled w/little local input.",economicCollapse

They're the ones who would take the time to read the whole post and consider it.   So kudos to you for reading & understanding the goddamned title & missing the point.  Thirdly, who's the gullible one here? You think any of them are actually changing their minds bc of a reddit post? Do you really? Maybe I could have used ""ignorant"", in the response, if what you claim I was going for was the case, then maybe you're right. But I wasn't.   Just so we're clear, someone like you, and you imply you're NOT a Trump voter, is nearer to the intended audience.   For example: maybe you're not too confident you can defend your position you intuitively feel is right. That you don't think you have enough of the historical information, and if you could look something up, it might help. Maybe I provided it (it seems most people, for example, don't know about the anti-corporate causes of the Boston Tea Party, or about the actual evidence of Reagan's racist election strategies. But if you knew it all, then maybe shut the fuck up. My post wouldn't have been for you either).   So here's some unsolicited advice (you started the offerings, so it should be fair game at this point):  Maybe try and not be so literal. Oh, and save the sanctimony. It's never becoming. Especially when you're wrong. And you are.  You, yourself, seem to imply their positions are not based in reason. So what, they're suddenly going to be reasonable w/ different vocabulary? I don't think you understand how human emotions work particularly well.   People change their minds, by and large, if they have an emotional stake in the other position. We've known this for literal millennia (try Aristotle's ""Rhetoric"" for the best distillation of that ancient knowledge).   Making a good rhetorical argument that appeals to emotions, leaving out premises, is called ·ºêŒΩŒ∏œçŒºŒ∑ŒºŒ±, (enthymeme). The emotional content is glossed bc, as Aristotle points out, regular folks don't have the time to deal with long, carefully reasoned arguments.  How exactly do you see anyone, let alone little ol' me, making a short argument that appeals to each and every Trump voter? Huh? There could be, actually, 80 million different reasons, if each had only one. So please, let me know what this great entheymeme I missed is. But I do have to ask, why didn't you include this pearl of wisdom in your original response? Are you trying to lose me?  Now, if they have just changed their minds, or are on the cusp, at this point, it's bc they already feel lied to. And what do people who are lied to afraid they look like to others?   Dumb. Fucking dumb. That's their fear.  So now all I would have done is identify the agents who treated them so. Then revealed how and why it was done. Bc I identified their emotion.  Oh, wait, that's exactly what Aristotle would advise me to do.  You, on the other hand, lash out toward me. Are you trying to change my mind? Bc you've done a piss poor job. But it's not your fault.   You've seem to have been lead to believe a gentle, well-reasoned argument can change the world. Maybe if someone is in the right headspace and willing to change their mind.  But whoever told you a well-reasoned, unemotional, fact-filled argument LIED to YOU. If you came up with it yourself, then you're just plain wrong. But it's ok, we all make mistakes.  If you don't like what I'm writing now, that it makes you feel dumb (which I didn't call you), then frankly, you're not ready for my OP. Go take a deep breath, have a snack, maybe call your mom, and wonder about things until you're ready. The post will still be here.  Wait, are you now going to tell me I'm wrong. And further, Aristotle was wrong? And the likely millions of people who read & used his ideas for 2300 years were/are just ... Wrong?  That's a bold statement. It sounds like every idealistic 2nd semester college freshman, or sophomore (it literally means ""cleaver fool"" [actually ""moron"" is closer], and is one of the oldest terms still in use. It's an English transliteration of a Greek transliteration (œÉŒøœÜœåœÇ + ŒºœâœÅœåœÇ) of a Sumerian word (I don't read, nor have cuneiform typeface on my phone, sorry) who now thinks they are an adult now and has ""figured it all out"". You know, better than everyone else, ever. Not the best company, if that's what you were going for.  People, especially politicians & their staffs, who think ""we just need to hit them with facts"" are today called ""technocrats"", aka ""wonks"".  They're wonky, literally. And they come across that way. Wonky candidates in the past 45 years: Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, & Kamala Harris.  Again, that's not great company. The only winner was Biden, who only won bc of COVID & maybe a little of the George Floyd protests.  Who weren't wonky? Reagan, Bill Clinton, GW Bush, Obama, Trump. Ponder the differences. It'll jump out at you.  In another response, a less belligerent responder asked me what they could do, what suggestions I had. My response was long, if not longer than my OP. Maybe take a look at it. There are dozens of suggestions. They're the things a person could do that might give a committed true believer pause & think ""Well they're a good person and don't like what Trump & the Republicans are doing. I wonder how that is possible.""   Those many suggestions are how you do it. Bc you go to know them. And you could also see what sort of emotional appeal would hook them... There's probably many that'll work on each person. But, that, of course, wasn't the intent of my OP, only for that particular response. It was the numerous facts that are available to explain how we got here, and to give ideas what to look out for and use when confronted with a Trump voter.  Since I'm on about numbers: as I wondered in another response by somebody being overly angry and literal... Where did you get that number ""half""?  Did you talk to half of the readers you are talking about? How did you find them? Do you have some great Reddit API info that let's you track readers? How did you contact them all and agree to your poll?  Unless... Maybe you were using ""half"" figuratively. Which is weird. Bc you seemed to want to take me to task upon your strict, literal, and quite uncharitable (do even know what the ""principle of charity"" is?), reading of my post.   Which rules are you wanting to play by, exactly? Inquiring minds want to know.  I did also put up some numbers in the OP about reading comprehension in the good ol' U-S-of-A, they're not good, at all.   So, if my readers were a representative sample of US adults, they give a pretty clear indication that the likelihood that anyone reading the post ""gets it"" is worse than a coin flip. It's more like rolling a 1 on a 4-sided die. Not good odds at all...  After all, you missed the point yourself.",economicCollapse

Let me ask you, ever you ever shorted a stock? Do you know what the maximum amount you might lose if you shorted a stock?  When you short a stock, you are borrowing a share you dont have and you are selling it hoping it will drop in price, then you buy it back and return the borrowed share.  What happens if the share goes up instead of down? How will you return the borrowed share you already sold?  You have to BUY it. On the MARKET. If the stock shoots up, you have to purchase the share at whatever the market price is and then return the share back to your browker.  THERE IS NO LIMIT TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN LOSE.",economicCollapse

I would rather not disclose personal information, but let's say shorting a stock is not even a very ""advanced strategy"". Even people that are beginners can do it, as long as the amounts are small (following a Kelly criterion for example) and the assets are liquid, the risk of liquidation of very unlikely.  The limit of how much you can lose is almost exactly determined by a stop loss in the position. Since both assets are currently highly liquid, the stop loss maybe will be missed by cents. Since the market cap is too high for both assets, the probability of the asset going up more than a 100% in a day, is nearly nil (not mathematically impossible though). So let's say the maximum you can lose is 10 USD, you can safely short a stock in the value of 5 USD, and unless you act completely recklessly and never check your position, it will be extremely hard to lose more than 10 USD even in a black swan event.

They don't bother me. I slapped back at as many as I got notifications for... And all but one ran off with their tail between their legs...  (The Edgelord has left the chat...)  The high numbers of neg responses either means I struck the right nerve(s), or I'm completely off my rocker.  Comments like yours let me know I'm still rockin' ('n' rollin')... So the wheels haven't quite come off yet...  But be careful with your ""Pulling a Costanza"" anti-billionaire opposition. They also like food and shelter. You're not gonna starve & give up your home are you? Naysaying & gainsaying agent paths to anywhere good. It's literally the theme of Peewee Herman's ""I know you are but what am I!?""  Take the golden mean, the middle way... Be reasonable (a better goal than ""rational"" ‚Äî rationalization is a defense mechanism for good reason!)  But in a pinch, I do agree. There are only two phrases we need to use when the 1% want us to do something, and they don't want us to have time to consider a reasonable response:  ""No.""  And...  ""NO, FUCK YOU!""  I also program. While it is helpful, AI isn't a problem any more than an axe is... The conditions that brought about the axe murder are the problems, not the least of which is the axe murderer himself. The axe is a tool, not the agent.   Don't worry, general AI isn't here yet. I think it's decades off.   What we do have to worry about is combinations of continuously, quaritatively improving, narrow AI that stack up to a qualitative change in the way we do everything.   Most people have no idea whatsoever about how these Turing machines actually do what they do. If you're even slightly more computer literate than the average person, ""Yeah, I program here and there,"" then many people treat you as the local super hacking Wizard! Now you can do magic.  Like Arthur C Clarke's ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" He was referencing less technological societies (including our own historical past) and saying that they couldn't even imagine a computer.   Hell, even idiots today (like me, if you ask several commenters) carry around supercomputers in their pockets. The newest iPhone which I have is no less than 32000 times faster and (in the same relative order of magnitude) smaller than my first college computer I bought in the second year that the public Internet was a thing.    I knew computers and I couldn't imagine I would be carrying several 90s mainframes in my pocket. Every day. With nearly the sum total of current human knowledge reachable within an instant ([uncracked] paywalls & other firewalls notwithstanding). And a photo studio & retouching lab. And a movie studio. And a movie theatre. And musical instruments & a studio. And an art studio. A transcriber. A publishing house. A marketing & advertising agency. And actual routes to publish and distribute all this, and more...  I carry goddamned magic in my pocket! Fuck you Harry Potter. Fake magic is real, real magic is fake. And I can deepfake the shit out of you, for real, if you cross me, ""wizard""!  Anyway...  Our problems are not just structural: systematic (planned)/systemic (emergent, ie self-assembled & self-perpetuating, but not necessarily planned) [this is why many people don't understand the concept of ""systemic racism"". They think it's the former, planned (like laws), as opposed to emergent out of particular social relations]. Like calling the President ""Mr President"" & shaking his hand instead of bowing.   Why do we do these? There are no laws on these...   We do these bc George Washington made them up. Nobody knew what to do with this new office. So he made himself ""Everyman"". (Interestingly, I've been led to believe Washington was the wealthiest man in the colonies at the time. Just imagine Elon humbling himself and also founding the modern ""Society of Cincinnati""!)  Anyway, in some other reply in this thread I list tons of cheap, easy, community building mutual aid ideas that also help prep for the coming... What I've taken to calling ""The Greatest Depression"".  My point being, computation in all its forms is only one tool in the box. Just like the axe.  The founding fathers' biggest mistake wasn't slavery. Didn't get me wrong, that was really bad. But they let it ride bc they thought that it would just fade away. They don't imagine the cotton gin, or other 19th century ""magic"". They thought their system would work bc they assumed shame would remain a prime motivator for moral behavior.    They were dead wrong.   That's why we've never finished Reconstruction. ""Unreconstructed"" is such a better insult than ""racist"", ""fascist"", or ""sister fucker"" (ok, that one is pretty good!). South Africa is in many ways dealing with race in a much more direct, honest, and more rapid way than we ever have, in under 30 years. Hell, they even offloaded that emerald heir who wants to die on Mars right after he cuts off your grandma's retirement check & the cancer research that would save your child from leukemia. South Africa is looking more and more wise letting him get away. It now looks like they packed off what was left of Apartheid with him...  What we really need is a return to ""ethical behavior"" not as some sort of moral calculus (consequentialism), or strict rule-based behavioral imperatives (deontology), or free for all moral relativism...  We've lost what I call ""social fidelity"". Not just in the sense of good reproduction of ideas & values, etc; but also in the original sense, ""faith"", which is trust in our neighbors. The contemptuous & contemptable language and behaviors today are the end result of excessive moral calculus. And now backstabbing and conjobs and greed and outright bullshitting are good, and giving away food is bad.   We need an ethics of virtues which establishes the goal of behaving in a way that brings about human flourishing. Which is weirdly ... Jesus-like... But some of my commenters who fancy themselves ""Christian"" can't stop themselves from foaming at the mouth while responding, and rejecting actual Bible quotes! (He had ""Christian"" in his username [r/usernamedoesntcheckout]).  They're also somewhat closer to what Marx thought we should do. But I'm no Marxist (Marx himself said if he's sure of one thing, it's that he's not a Marxist!) Anarchy is the way for me! But Marx is way holier than current antisocial (in the DSM5 sense) economic ""saints"" like the sociopath Milton Friedman. What a douchebag.  I can't remember where in all these comments that list is, but there are at least 2 dozen ideas... See what you think. If you're so inclined, share it.
