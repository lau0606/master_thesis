On that last one, RDDT offered its IPO to us users. Did you buy? If you did you beat the market a few times over this year.   Every company listed above in the 5yr range were and are obvious buys. The problem isn't that people don't know which sticks to buy. The problem is most people don't have the money to invest. Additionally people get greedy and look for long shots. A smart investor that starts with millions to invest can pretty easily beat the market year or year. No insider trading required. Again, all the stocks lost above on the 5yr line are obvious. Likewise, RDDT's IPO was obvious.",economy

Like literally if my house hold income is like $280k, the next percentile up is like $500-600k, then it goes to like $900K-1.2M, then like $4M+  When you’re knocking on that door and realize how good you have it STILL pales in comparison to the uber rich, it’s laughable.  making these dudes at the absolute top pay their fair share would solve the problem.

No Mention of Decentralized Cryptocurrencies: There is no direct language suggesting any regulation, restriction, or control over decentralized assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Musk is a national security threat of the highest order and must not be permitted to have access to America's bank. Similarly, Musk must be prevented from exploiting America's data.  Musk's DOGE was conceived to skirt disclosure requirements and vetting of China businessman Elon Musk, who has disqualifying ties to the CCP. Musk's Tesla operating in China is subject to Chinese law requiring it to ""assist or cooperate"" with the Chinese Government's ""intelligence work"". Tesla Shanghai produces 50% of Tesla's global auto output.  On January 17, 2025, the unanimous SCOTUS identified that a national security threat existed with ByteDance Ltd. See: *TikTok Inc. v. Garland*, 604 U.S. 3 (2025):  >ByteDance Ltd. is subject to Chinese laws that require it to “assist or cooperate” with the Chinese Government’s “intelligence work” and to ensure that the Chinese Government has “the power to access and control private data” the company holds. H. R. Rep. No. 118–417, p. 4 (2024) (H. R. Rep.); see 2 App. 673–676.  Musk's connection to the CCP, (like ByteDance's connection) makes Musk a national security threat to the United States. As a condition of Musk doing business in China, Musk must “assist or cooperate” with the Chinese Government’s “intelligence work”.  Musk is doing the bidding of Beijing on issues such as TikTok, Taiwan, H-1B visas, and tariffs. Now Musk's attempting to rob the U.S. Treasury.

This is what we know so far about Musk's hostile takeover of the U.S. government and its payment system.  The new team at OPM includes software engineers and Brian Bjelde, who joined Musk's SpaceX venture in 2003 as an avionics engineer before rising to become the company's vice president of human resources. Bjelde's role at OPM is that of a senior adviser. Another senior adviser is Riccardo Biasini, a former engineer at Tesla and most recently a director at The Boring Company, Musk's tunnel-building operation in Las Vegas.  Amanda Scales, also a former Musk employee, is now OPM's so-called chief of staff.

The 21-year-old will serve as a senior advisor to Scott Kupor (Trump/Musk pick for the director of OPM), and the newly graduated high schooler will directly report to Amanda Scales. [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lackeys-office-personnel-management-opm-neuralink-x-boring-stalin/), reporting on the shake-up did not name the two individuals out of sensitivity to their ages.  All (with the exception of OPM Director Scott Kupor) appear to be Musk's employees or hired and supervised by Musk's employees.  New OPM Director Scott Kupor was a managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm.

When they launched the coin, only 20% of the coins are in circulation for trading, inflating the value as people are only trading a small subset of the total ICO (more demand then supply). Once the price is pumped enough, the insiders start dumping (rug pull). As soon as they start mass selling, the price collapses (More supply then Demand).  Blub below is from this article: [https://bizbeat.nus.edu.sg/thought-leadership/article/trump-meme-coin-promoting-or-destabilising-the-cryptocurrency-space/](https://bizbeat.nus.edu.sg/thought-leadership/article/trump-meme-coin-promoting-or-destabilising-the-cryptocurrency-space/)  # Exploitative nature of $Trump  The Trump Coin is the latest meme coin that has entered the fray, and is facing criticism for its speculative nature, lack of clear utility, and potentially exploiting political fervor for profit. The value of Trump Coin is also highly volatile, driven by market sentiment and not by economic fundamentals. Slightly more than a week after its launch, $Trump fell to $25.73 per coin, a drop of around 65% from its high.  Even though crypto finance started as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance, more recent crypto ventures pivoted towards centralized governance. Trump’s ventures control 80 percent of the $Trump supply, yielding significant influence over the price.  One significant concern is the potential for $Trump to serve as a conduit for funneling money to Trump’s personal interests or political campaigns, bypassing traditional transparency and accountability mechanisms. Such cryptocurrency could obscure the sources and uses of funds, enabling corruption or unethical financial practices. Anonymous or pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies amplifies these risks, raising questions about the oversight and regulation of politically themed digital assets.  President Trump’s involvement in crypto also presents ethical and national security risks. His financial stake could influence regulatory decisions, disincentivizing him from favoring restrictions that might negatively affect the value of his tokens. Concerns about foreign agents anonymously using the tokens to gain leverage over Trump’s policies are also valid.  Prominent investor Mark Cuban echoed these sentiments, while expressing strong skepticism about the meme coin investments. “This is not crypto any more than Madoff was just buying and selling shares of stock,” said Cuban, while celebrity Bill Maher, compared the meme coin to Bernie Madoff selling Pokémon cards.",economy

The actual gold standard ended long before 1971. The Bretton Woods system was a gold exchange standard, which is fundamentally quite different.   >a system that benefits EVERYONE when everyone produces, not just benefits the ones closest to the money printer wit the most amount of assets   Money is created when it is lent and borrowed. So literally anyone that borrows money for any purpose benefits from the system. It's not just the richest people and banks. Credit creation is what modern economics is built on, and has been since the Italian bankers formalized it 500 years ago. It's what allows ordinary people to get their hands on (credit) money when all the ""hard"" money is sitting in Scrooge's vault somewhere.   Take the history of our own country as an instructive example. Thanks to the increasingly oppressive policies of the UK at that time, there was a lack of specie in the colonies. So they developed paper credit monies issued by states. Amda Smith even wrote about it as a novel experiment in creating legal tender out of paper. Eventually, the money issue became so divisive that we rebelled over it.

As I explained, modern credit money is created when loans are made, and destroyed when they are paid back. That means the broad money supply is NOT determined by some single entity or Central authority, it is a function of the lending and borrowing decisions of countless individuals, firms, banks and other institutions.   >I'd rather life get easier, not harder.   It IS getting easier. Productivity is rising, real wages are rising. You're implying that things are getting worse for people but that just doesn't match reality. And anybody who really looks objectively at things over the long term can easily see that this is the case. A working class American today, even someone living paycheck to paycheck, has a far higher real standard of living than many middle class people 100 years ago.    The problem is, you are looking at things from such a narrow perspective. It's totally understandable, from an individual perspective, that you would want the things you own to increase in value without any work on your part. But is that really a good model for society as a whole? Does it really make sense that people should be rewarded for doing nothing? No.   Who truly benefits from the modern credit creation system? The people who make profitable loans and the people who turn a profit by borrowing money. In other words, the people actually doing things; allocating resources and creating value. People who simply hold on to their money, who don't do anything productive with it, who don't spend it or invest it or use it to create value in some other way, lose out as their money loses value over time. AND THATS A GOOD THING. We WANT to reward the people who are doing real work and creating real value, NOT the people who are just squatting on some assets hoping they appreciate or earning economic rents in some other way despite providing no real value to society. That's why people who actually create value deal in credit, and only speculators and rent seekers are crypto stans.",economy

As I described, lending decisions in our modern system are made by a huge and diverse range of institutions, many of them competing directly against each other. There isn't one central bureaucracy that determines all the loans that get made, that would be a ridiculous distortion of reality.   >The money in your bank is not technically yours   Demonstrably false. Credit money is an asset. The money in my bank is a promise by my bank to pay me the equivalent in cash or reserves. And the system is set up in a very robust manner to make sure the banks can always make good on that promise. Meanwhile, crypto entities like exchanges offer far far fewer protections. You're an unsecured creditor with no legal recourse if you lose your money, or if the institution goes down, in contrast with traditional banks, where your money is protected even if the entire bank fails. Even if you self-custody your crypto, there is still no legal protection against theft or fraud.

And we actually talk a lot about this in the Bitcoin community because people always like to say people were ""lucky"" if they bought early and held;  Early Bitcoin adopters from VERY early on had zero clue Bitcoin was going to be worth anything. And if they held that long, which 99.999% did not, it was through multiple 85% draw downs. You basically had to be extremely smart, or be ok with massive risk, uncertainty, and losses.  Basically, no one in the right mind held from $1 to $1,000 without selling unless they lost their keys. People do not have the psychological capacity for that. When it comes to assets that are new and misunderstood, people sell at 50%, 100%, 2x, 3,x, maybe 10x if they are really strong minded and extremely lucky  The majority of the big holders now bought during or after the 2017 bullrun (and on chain analysis will show this to you if you care to look) when resources were readily available to articulate why bitcoin would continue rising in price.

If a lot of people buy it, the value goes up. If a lot of people sell it, the value goes down.  In a stock market, when a company is doing well, lots of people want that stock, so the price goes up. If the CEO of that company starts doing nazi salutes and people dislike that, they sell the stock and it's value drops.  But with Crypto, there is no company or stock. It's literally just a digitized blockchain that requires mining to create coins. I don't really understand how that works though but it makes a crypto coin. People buy these  coins and hope that others do too to inflate the value of that coin. Since it's not tied to a company or the economy, it's incredibly volatile and almost impossible to predict if it will gain or lose money.  Meme coins are crypto coins that are usually created as a joke or scam. They don't have much of a blockchain and are usually sold by a celebrity to get people to buy in and artificially inflate the price of that coin. Then the person running the coin does a rug pull. This is where the creator sells all of their coins after everyone has invested and no longer does any work to add to the blockchain and leaves with all the money.  So crypto is incredibly susceptible to scams. Also, while encryption can make crypto wallets harder to hack, it's not impossible.  Trump did this with his meme coin before his inauguration, he and his friends invested heavily into it, and then he used his position as president to announce it to his American fan base. As more and more people bought it, the price inflated. As soon as the price hit whatever Trump's goal was, he and his friends sold all of their coins taking all of the invested money. Because so many coins were now available, the price dropped and people were left with a bunch of worthless coins, because the creator has abandoned the coin and is no longer adding to the blockchain. This is known as being left ""holding the bag"". About 810,000 people lost about 12 billion dollars when he did this.  Also, crypto buying and selling doesn't go through banks. So if you send or receive a payment, there is no record of it, except on the block chain itself or a ledger. So, say you wanted to take a bribe from a hostile government. You invent a meme coin and then announce that coin. The hostile government then buys enough of that meme coin to inflate the value of the coin to the correct bribe amount. You then sell all of your shares of the meme coin and walk away with all of the bribe money. The hostile government is left holding the bag but doesn't care because it wasn't an investment, it was just a transfer of funds. And no one can prove anything because you control the ledger.  Now, why is all of this bad? Because he wants to put our tax money into crypto coins. Now, he can invest his personal money into a coin, then use the treasury money to buy a lot more to artificially inflate that coin price , then yank out his money and leave America holding the bag.  If my understanding of crypto is off, someone more knowledgeable in crypto can correct me. =D",economy

Countries like Norway, Abu Dhabi or Saudi Arabia, usually because the governments sell a great deal of natural resources like Oil and bring in more money than they spend to run their governments.  But our government in the US runs on a deficit, and we have a substantial amount of debt, so we are essentially borrowing money to invest it into crypto.

This move positions the United States as one of the largest holders of bitcoin globally. ￼  Historically, such significant governmental endorsements of bitcoin have led to increased market confidence and price appreciation. For instance, El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 and has continued to bolster its reserves, recently surpassing 6,000 bitcoins.  While this strategy has attracted global attention, it has also faced challenges, including volatility and scrutiny from international financial institutions.  ￼  The immediate impact of the U.S. establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has been an uptick in bitcoin’s price, reflecting heightened investor confidence. However, the long-term effects will depend on the government’s management of these assets and the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in the financial system. As more countries consider integrating bitcoin into their reserves, the cryptocurrency’s value could experience increased stability and growth.  ￼ ￼ ￼",economy

Right now, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) is just consolidating Bitcoin the government already owns from criminal seizures. Step one is literally cleaning up the mess: getting all that BTC accounted for, secured, and under one roof. Think of it like finding money in your couch cushions before you even consider opening your wallet.  First, audit and centralize existing holdings.  Second, use **budget-neutral** moves (like the Exchange Stabilization Fund) to accumulate more without new costs.  Third, build momentum and eventually lock it all in through bipartisan legislation so it can’t just get rug-pulled by the next administration.  The game theory here is wild because if the U.S. doesn’t move fast, you better believe China, Russia, and the Gulf states will. And once that race kicks off, good luck catching up.

What a bunch of ignorant nonsense.  Nobody fails to see it. The volatility is there and it's fine. Look at a volatility chart and you'll see how it's dropping year over year.  Think for more than 5 seconds and you'll realize there is no other way for an asset to become monetized on a global scale within 30 years without huge volatility - it can't go up in a straight line because some people get too hyped when they see it go up and cause price bubbles, and other people like you are occasionally too sceptical and cause panic sells. This is just normal market behavior. If you paid any attention the normal stock market works the same way and occasional market crashes are a recurring and normal occurrence. It's just less volatile because its harder to move the price by 1% at its current market cap. When Bitcoin is done growing it'll be more stable than gold and the stock market.  Also I see you haven't even bothered to read the article I sent because the subject of volatility is treated there as well.

It was a recipe for disaster.  The U.S., on the other hand, has proven its resilience over and over throughout history. The issues you’re feeling right now like lower purchasing power, lack of jobs, or housing prices being through the roof-are real. But Europeans have been feeling this for years, ever since the covid policies.  All the government stimulus in 2020 isn’t free; it has to be “paid up” somehow. You can’t print trillions of dollars without breaking something. To fix this, you need to tighten liquidity, which is what central banks have been doing. This will lead to more fiscal responsibility, less cash misallocation, less risky investment-some of this is already happening. Depending on how resilient the economy is, this could lead to a recession (for many, it already has), but eventually, it will lead to a productivity boost-more work, more innovation, and that’s what will make the economy healthier in the long run.  The U.S. faces economic problems, but they don’t have 60 different ethnicities to keep in check. There aren’t barbarians invading the country, and U.S. doesn't have a weak military. Whether people like it or not, the U.S. is still a global power, and it will probably be like that for a while.  Betting against the U.S. isn't a safe bet.",economy

Tether is supposed to have $1 USD to back each and every Tether coin, but it very likely  doesn’t. More Tether can (and has been) created out of nothing to pump Bitcoin.

True currencies don’t act like stocks. Currencies are just denominational contracts. They aren’t an investment. A dollar doesn’t become more valuable if you hold onto it.

Businesses can't plan with that kinda turbulence and incoherent fiscal policy positions coming from the head of the federal government.

Slow spending will eventually lead to more job losses.  And if interest rates remain relatively high along with a high 10 year yield, consumer credit will dry up and so will demand for mortgages.

Absolutely NO reason why they should be funded by taxpayer dollars.   Charity belongs in the realm of churches and billionaires, and not a role of government.   Why?  Too easy for freeloaders and grifters to piggyback on to these government entities and use them for personal enrichment, political motives, and for many other causes far more sinister.   Who do you think is funding all those HAMAS riots, ""summer of love"", Antifa, George Floyd riots, etc?   It's our taxpayer dollars taken by far left political entities.    They are very open about it too.   You see all these leftist Democrats chanting now ""we have to FIGHT!""   using every 4 letter word in the book, and inciting violence.  We the honest, good people of America deserve better.    There is a 90% silent majority, moderate left and moderate right, that has tolerated this nonsense in the past, but no more.  Easy solution:   defund it all, and if these radical far left crazies truly have the support of the people, they can go out and fundraise in the mainstream the old fashioned way.   Absolutely no reason why America's taxpayer dollars or deficit spending should go towards these extremist movements.  Just common sense, just like I would not support taxpayer money going to the far Right, to fire bomb abortion centers and incite violence against any people who are non-believers in Christianity, for example.  Government needs to do only the tasks that are essential, and no more.   Social programs are not the role of the government, because they can be manipulated so easily into something nefarious.   Similar for Climate Change.   Whether you believe in climate change or not, having governments use this as a vehicle for starting programs and initiatives is very dangerous.   Look at all the damage done by Biden Administration in 2021 with the ""Deficit Reduction Act"" which wasted so much money on absolutely nothing of value.    Now all the money is gone, no change to any climate issue, and all we have left are the receipts for the trillions of dollars of new debt that we will be paying into oblivion.     But that was never the point to do anything, because these climate change politicians never had any intention to actually change anything.   It is all about creating a narrative, a smoke screen to get people behind them to spread political propaganda, and nothing more.   Again, all these kind of things are best left to the private sector.    Companies will innovate and markets will change rapidly based on true needs and value provided.  The fact that the Left has attacked Tesla and Elon Musk for simply stating the obvious truth shows you everything you need to know.   Elon Musk has arguably done more to help the climate on Earth more than any other human being in existence.   If you hear him talk, he will say that we have to study and take great care of our planet.    Yet when he shows all the fraud and overspending of the government, the mask comes off these crazy Leftists, and they show their true nature.     It was NEVER about true climate change for these people.   This is truly diabolical and pure EVIL.  Think about it.",economy

All four cases they brought against Trump were desperately scraped together.   New York literally passed a law simply to then be able to prosecute Trump, and even then, their arguments objectively were simply laughable.  And let's not forget the ""special prosecutor"" looking into Joe Biden came to the conclusion that yes, Biden did a lot of illegal things with classified documents, but he was too old and senile to defend himself in court, so we are not going to prosecute him.  Actually look seriously at what you are saying.   Do you even understand how absurd you sound?

A few facts about this: USA and Denmarks and Greenland have an agreement about defence of Greenland. First signed in 1951 between USA and Denmark and confirmed in 2004 with also Greenland signing. The agreement allows US troops in Greenland and at its peak during the cold war there were 15.000 US troops in many air bases, naval bases and radar stations across greenland. However, after the cold war ended US started withdrawing and today there are just 200 US troops left in one air base. But if the terrirorry is again being center of geopolitical tension there is absolutely nothing preventing US from negotiating re-opening of many of its bases and sending more military. Meanwhile Denmark contributes with some (mostly naval) presence and generally keeps the Greenland population firmly on the ""right side"" by very heavy subsidies to the Greenland population. Should US choose to send troops back and re open bases, a place to start could be the abandoned Camp Century where they earlier had a project involving nuclear defence. Upon its abandonment by the US army only the reaction chamber of the nuclear generator was taken while a large amount of biological and radioactive waste was left as it was hoped time would encapsulate it by snow and ice. However, with global warming the waste is now re surfacing and it is a great idea to have US back to clean this up before it pollutes the very fragile arctic ecosystems. Hope this clean up is part of the calculations.",economy

Depends on what you think is radical. For the last 30 years + we’ve had presidents who basically fall in like with the state department, with very little actually changing from president to president. Having someone who doesnt fall in line is important and necessary.   It’s good imo that businesses can’t plan / need to react on these tariffs. Tariffs are a tax. We don’t want them to tax plan around it or up charge consumers. True uncertainty in the market will generally limit risky investments, but maybe that’s ok for the minute if the outcome ends up being a win for us.   Not sure what industry you’re in, but tariffs in some industries are **absolutely** needed. For example, accounting firms have stopped hiring college students because we’re outsourcing all the grunt work to India for like $4 an hour.",economy

With love and respect: First, human beings aren’t illegals. They can’t by definition be, unless we delegate them into a sub-species.  They can 100% have “illegal status” of arbitrary geography lines, or be “illegally present” in a country against these same lines. Encourage a reframe of the way we speak of humans. We’ll end up in a better spot as a country.  Secondly, remitting to another country is a fraction of the value produced inside the US. Encourage you to re-read my post and do some impartial research on the economic issue (which is what I’m arguing here).  Third, say you replaced these immigrant workers with US citizens. For one, companies in both blue and red states would never pay for this higher labor rate, you as a consumer would never pay for this higher labor rate, and therefore the service and agriculture economies would be a fraction of what they are today.  Hence, those replacement US citizen workers would not “recycle” those wages into the economy, because most of them would not take these jobs to begin with.  The problem is structural and tops down (govt -> companies -> US born labor -> immigrant labor). If you don’t believe me, please please read up on every single anti-immigrant labor movement since the founding of the US (Caribbean, Chinese, Irish, etc.).",economy

Thomas argued in his 1970 history The Luddites that machine-breaking was one of the very few tactics that workers could use to increase pressure on employers, undermine lower-paid competing workers, and create solidarity among workers. ""These attacks on machines did not imply any necessary hostility to machinery as such; machinery was just a conveniently exposed target against which an attack could be made.""[10] Historian Eric Hobsbawm has called their machine wrecking ""collective bargaining by riot"", which had been a tactic used in Britain since the Restoration because manufactories were scattered throughout the country, and that made it impractical to hold large-scale strikes.[13][14] An agricultural variant of Luddism occurred during the widespread Swing Riots of 1830 in southern and eastern England, centring on breaking threshing machines.""
