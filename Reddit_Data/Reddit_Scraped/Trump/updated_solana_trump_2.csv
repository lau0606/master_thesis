Never again!!!  Be careful and stay disciplined guys and you will find your success in the trenches!! Good luck!! A lot of opportunities are coming soon!!",solana

Crypto is a pvp game don‚Äôt take fights you aren‚Äôt sure you‚Äôll win. No harm in selling out a little early either if you made money you made money just because you only made 100k when someone else made a million doesn‚Äôt mean shit yah know be humble with crypto its risky.

When I first got into crypto in 2021, I joined a discord ""crypto research group"", and was kinda blown away by how different their approach to it was. I was mostly just spot buying btc and a few other major alts to hold, but I also did a little bit of what I thought was degen gambling, and bought some shitcoins to flip real quick if possible, but still all spot trading. Some won some lost but I'm still hodling the (mostly) btc and other majors for the long long term. What astounded me was that literally everyone else in the ""research group"" were just doing somewhere between 5 to 50 dollar (attempted) swing trades, always using crazy leverage. Sometimes even like 20x and shit. Almost all of them were basically broke and using whatever little money they could scrounge up to try to turn $20 into $8000 in 5 minutes. They would post pics of wins and losses and literally 99% of them were losses and these people were just doing these ridiculous bets over and over and over again where it goes down 0.5% or something and they immediately get liquidated.  I never once saw any pics of them showing tremendous gains either. If anything it would be like they got lucky and turned $20 into $100, after their 18th try. It was honestly so pathetic and hilarious at the same time, but thinking back on it now it makes me feel gross, just watching all these gambling addicts getting off on having a casino in their hand, instead of actually trying to invest in something that may actually be worth something in the future.   When they started talking about creating a shitcoin to pump and dump is when I left the group. Really sad and pathetic.",solana

Baby doge coin just listed i put 70 into it not knowing what I was doing. This the furthest I got. Buying on pancake swap. 2hrs later talking to my dad showing him I noticed it was sky high 70 turned into 680 I was shocked after my dad showed me lol. He was excited well sell it then. But I laughed at him.   You don't just sell it dad. üòÜ   My first pick and it blew up for 10min then started to fall fast. My 70 - 680 to 240 by the time I googled slippage and finally sold it.   Onto baby moon wolf. This time I had a plan. 0ut 70 in the cash 50% out every time it doubles. It doubled 3x and the 4th run it went from the 70 to around 110 then it fell apart.   I still think that's how you meme coin.   If you want a meme coin you can just put double into it. If you think its easy 2x. Put double in. Then cash 50% when it 2x. Now you ride for free.   Or 50% out everytime it 2x and not buy more. By the time you've sold it the next shiny üí© will be out. Reset budget and go again.   I haven't tried my luck at recently added picks since that day.

Meme coins have a thing of repeating themselves   Don‚Äôt just throw yourself in to a random coin literally watch the coin until it gets rugged even if you see it go up 10M in market cap do not give in to FOMO and after it gets rugged it will come back in the next 5 - 10 minutes watch it and make sure it starts around the same market cap at that point you can assess the risk.   I‚Äôve been meme trading for 4 months I have lost around $500 and barely just started making money off it. Sometimes I even just take a 5% win.   Utilize selling 20-25% shares rather then 100% all at once I‚Äôve made 2 sol‚Äôs off of 0.5 solely because I only kept selling 25% at a time and after you‚Äôve made 100% profit it doesn‚Äôt matter if it gets rugged cause you made your money.    After you sell 100% completely forget about that coin you made your money now move on to the next one don‚Äôt keep going back and looking that you could have made more my biggest regret is going back and thinking I could have made more and I think about it all day affecting my next trades. It‚Äôs all part of the process don‚Äôt let it tilt you It‚Äôs all part of learning curve. I‚Äôm not professional but everyone learns from their mistakes.   Good luck with any future trades my friend you got this in the bag! You did it once you can do it again just remember 99% of coins are setup to rug pull,solana

The early 2020s bull run was driven by the average person all of a sudden being able to leverage crypto on-chain and the explosion of crypto yeild products for ordinary investors.  The fact the fed was still paying 0% interest kept margin cheap because companies were promising 5% returns for investing in crypto yield products, and this money was ultimately the source of stablecoins people were borrowing on-chain..  Two things happened at once which are related.  The change in fed policy made these crypto yield products a lot less popular so people started pulling out -- which increases the cost to borrow on-chain because there is simply less money to go around.  The second thing that happens is that when the rate of growth stops being greater than the cost to borrow it's time to cash in your winnings.

I told her I had my money and an eye bond making 6% and she said oh, I can help you make that just overnight so I trusted her and I pulled my money out of my bond and sent it to an account that she said it went to Hong Kong exchange, which was now I find out a fake Kong Kong exchange. I even went out and borrowed money from two of my friends that I had to end up taking a loan out of my house to pay them back to come up with $50,000 that it eventually made 209,000 on that fake Hong Kong exchange and then I had to get a recovery service well before I did that I tried. I think it was four times to retrieve the money out of that fake Hong Kong exchange. It kept saying oh you gotta send $2000. That‚Äôs a fee that your country charges to send money overseas so well I believed them and then they said all your government sent the money back. They wouldn‚Äôt honor the 2000 so they said you gotta send another 2000 so I did that and then they said all your bank sent it back and then I did another 2000 Again they would not honor the 2000. I did another 2000 then it go all we got hacked so I just gave up and I got a recovery service that did an extraction on that fake con exchange and pull the money into a wallet which is I think it‚Äôs ZIRAXIA Wallet‚ÄãAnd then they said when I asked him if I could withdraw some, they said all your bitcoin got contaminated and it needs to do a mining process that‚Äôs gonna cost $16,000 so of course I couldn‚Äôt do anything there so I got another recovery service to pull that money out of there and put it in They put it in an offshore bank that‚Äôs supposed to be citizens Bank of Arlington Texas. They have a client they have an office in Arlington, Texas, but this is supposed to be an offshore bank and then the offshore bank says no you gotta have $4500 for us to activate your account.

I still have long term crypto holds from 2017 that I still believe in, thankfully. But I‚Äôve round tripped those during last two bull runs as well whereas I could‚Äôve sold near the top and bought back during the bear and had profits.  So unless I have so much conviction in these handful of projects that holding them for 10+ years until mass adoption will make me rich, it‚Äôs a tricky call. I personally don‚Äôt want to round trip them again (watch I sell them this bull and then mass adoption comes)  There‚Äôs a handful of AI/utility projects I bought in the last year that I don‚Äôt want to round trip either, because who knows which of them will actually be successful long term. We know what happened during the .com bubble.  So learning to have a bit of a trader‚Äôs mentality and practice only makes sense to me. My problem has always been getting married to my coins when I think now that I should always be taking profits no matter what. If I want to marry a coin, I can marry bitcoin.

Ironically, the chain itself is a rugpull because huge amounts of SOL will be released by the network for its venture capitalists in March, April and May.  Add to that the yearly inflation of 5-10%.  Add to that the hyper centralisation of the validators (only 1000 validators, and history showed us that most of them collude).  At last, Solana's real TPS is around 300. That's the same as in the Ethereum ecosystem whose next upgrade in march will bring 600 TPS.  No reason to stay on Solana, it is a well organised scam chain.",solana

ETH Denver thing can help with this. We also have Nvidia AI Conference thingy in March I believe.  The consensus view among primary dealers at the new york fed is that QT will end in june this year. Assuming risk-on assets will have a few months' lag, Q4 can be the final top. But Lark Davis says that if Bitcoin Strategic Reserve gets approved or not in the congress in September/October, it'll be the market cycle peak.  In another video Lark Davis says the following: M2 money supply can go into Q1 or even Q2 of 2026 according to Lark which quotes Raoul Pal and markets usually lag a few months behind. So, we can see a market cycle peak in Q2 2026.  Raoul Pal says: this cycle can play into the end of year or even into Q1 2026.  Raoul Pal thinks cycle top will be in Q1 2026 because he thinks liquidity will peak a little bit before that.  Yet in another video Lark Davis says the following: Wall street predicts the US will end QT in Q2. Lark says this gives us the potential for rally in Q3 and Q4. Then May, Aprilish market top. Then QT ends. September-October markets start pumping again to December or January or something. More banks are pivoting to QE, the FED will do too. Only a matter of time.  Arthur Hayes predicts the crypto market peak in March 2025, driven by $600B liquidity from U.S. Fed & Treasury.  Some people like Aaron from coin bureau trading, Lark Davis (Lark says he expects local BTC top in March or April) etc believes 'the' top will be in November 2025  BTC and crypto in general relies on global M2 money supply. Global M2 money supply drives the bull market. Bull market typically tops out around 115-150 days before the top of the liquidity cycle comes in. The top of liquidity cycle is anticipated to arrive in January 2026. So, according to this the market top will be between August-(October-November).  Bull markets in crypto and other asset classes often experience pullback around March and April because of tax season (in the US and possibly in other countries too), quarterly financial reporting, people selling crypto in anticipation of 'sell in may and go away', and some other things. There are of course coins that didn't follow this pattern in past bull cycles (they peaked in April and didn't lose much momentum in April), so don't just rely on this when selling. House of Crypto expects a rally towards March.  Lark Davis says that 4-year credit cycles in China are important. Next top is probably March 2025 for Chinese credit cycles. And when the Chinese credit cycle tops, markets will go down following that.  Alternate cycle theory (because of etfs) suggests that April 2025 top is a possibility according to cryptocon\_.",solana

It's so easy to get caught up in the excitement of seeing big gains early on, especially with meme coins, but the downside  rug pulls is just brutal.  A strategy that can help you avoid a lot of the risks you‚Äôve encountered is **DCA**, especially when it comes to more established and liquid coins. Instead of putting all your funds into one coin at once (which can feel like a gamble), by DCA you are investing a fixed amount of money into  a larger more established coin on a regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. This way, you're spreading out your risk and reducing the impact of volatility. Plus, you don't have to worry about trying to time the market, which can be incredibly difficult.  Also, to help avoid **99% of rug pulls**, focus on **more established coins** with significant liquidity and a solid track record. When I look for projects to invest in, I make sure the coin has **$200K or more in liquidity**, has been around for **at least 20 hours or more**, and has **over $5M in daily transaction volume**. This shows that there's serious trading activity and it‚Äôs more likely to be a reliable investment compared to the low-liquidity, highly volatile meme coins that can easily get rug-pulled.  You may not get the 32x returns like you did with your early wins, but you can expect more consistent returns ‚Äì something around **$40 to $100 per day**. It‚Äôs a slower, steadier approach, but in the long run, it can add up significantly, and you‚Äôll feel more in control of your portfolio.

It really does seem like most of them eventually go to zero. I do not even think the creators are trying to build anything that will last. This is a quick money grab. I find it funny that a 13 year old can create a meme coin and at the same be labeled as the ""Dev"".   Just ridiculous how meme coins have evolved. No utility, no viable function or added value. Just pure gambling. That being said there are a lot of great comments on here that I feel are spot on. I trade these crappy meme coins like a ninja. Get in and out quick before anyone notices you. I am not after a 14,000% gainer. Singles add up. Take 10% here and 20% there. Be safe and do not mix emotions into this game.   I never listen to the ""community"" when they preach about diamond hands and patience. They are just looking for exit liquidity. I stay out of TG groups and X. Just trade with the momentum, volume and use a few chart indicators that line up with my strategy.   I do exercise patience but that is only used when I am looking for a perfect setup to trade.

Let me give you an example. You put $10 on a coin, it triples in price, following your idea, you take out the 10 and leave the rest. After a 3x pump there's a huge probability that you'll get a fat red candle. Your profits go from 20 to 10 to 5... Your mind starts thinking 'well, I haven't lost any money so maybe I'll leave it on there' 99% of coins will go to 0. You're back to square 1. Wouldn't it be better to pull out your money, and if you have strong conviction in the coin buy the dip?  And if I do double dip, I'll only put in half of my profits. I never triple dip.

Every blockchain is geared for a specific purpose, degens control most of the volume and we're just crashing on people's couches right now.  To create a sustainable memecoin ecosystem you'd need to have decentralization checks and balances, and trustless wealth redistribution based on new liquidity entering the ecosystem to slow the wealth gap widening during low periods of activity.  The issue, though, is that it's not about building the blockchain, it's about obtaining/retaining the volume.  It would need to be simple, fast, cheap, yet resistant to bots, plus about a hundred other things that I wrote down when i conceptualized this awhile back.  It's walking a tightrope, but it's possible.",solana

Kaspa is that one coin that‚Äôs going to shock the world and people fomo in. Yes I get what you‚Äôre saying about the technology but you‚Äôre forgetting that there isn‚Äôt anything as decentralized as Kas other than bitcoin. Btc down fall is lack of speed and smart contracts.
