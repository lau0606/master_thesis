Solana has now the image of a scam chain, the chain of rugpulls. Ironically, the chain itself is a rugpull because considerable amounts of SOL will be released by the network for its venture capitalists in March, April and May.  2. Yearly inflation of 5-10% (Sol validators + usual VC unlocks). That's the worst creation rate in the world of smart contract blockchains.  3. Hyper centralisation of the validators (only 1000 validators, and history showed that most of them collude). Solana is an expensive database, not a secure blockchain.  4. Solana's real TPS is around 300. Any other number was faked by Solana's marketing team by adding protocol communications (that's the same as in the Ethereum ecosystem whose next upgrade in March will bring 600 TPS).

Sure you can devote some to alts, butnDCA long term doesn‚Äôt always work out as many die out and do nothing. Ethereum is your best bet in that sense as it has the most dominance, but I personally would not DCA into any alts, and instead try to buy solid ones during bear markets as a gamble.  You won‚Äôt be mad in 4-8 years DCAing Bitcoin. Just stop looking at the price. Your goal is accumulation, the price up or down doesn‚Äôt matter.  Admittedly my approach when Bitcoin went down last cycle was to increase my DCA size when I could. Lower price, more in. This can also work well, but you need to have some cash for that (I just restricted lifestyle for a bit to increase my budget, or dipped into some savings).  Don‚Äôt go DCAing some random memecoin or alt that might not be here in 4 years. Consider alts a gamble, diversify when the time is right.",CryptoMarkets

These are currently less than 1% and no blockchain has ever had more than 10% of its rewards in the form of transaction fees. Even Peter Todd recognises this and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs a big proponent of tail emissions. The only other option is to support OP_CAT and embrace scaling and smart contracts to drive usage.  And it‚Äôs naive to think that institutions will mine at a loss, and also misses the point a little bit. Altruism is not a security mechanism. An argument can be made for institutions protecting their investment, however knowing the issues ahead of time will curtail them investment in the first place (we‚Äôre still only seeing 1% asset allocations, if that). But importantly it‚Äôs still pushing out individuals and smaller players I.e. centralizing hash power. You‚Äôre then essentially regressing to a consortium blockchain.

I don‚Äôt know if I got lucky or what, but I was playing with low amounts of money and selling fast as fuck. I‚Äôd dump $500 or so into a brand new coin and sell almost immediately on jumps. I‚Äôd never hold longer than an hour or so.   Some coins I‚Äôd make $20 on, some I‚Äôd make $2000 on.   I‚Äôd lose here and there, but overall I made quite a bit more than I lost.   Eventually I got out of meme‚Äôs towards the end of December, it just felt too intense and risky for me. But it feels more and more people got into meme‚Äôs soon after. And I feel now, that that market is over saturated.   Also, I don‚Äôt understand anyone who is holding meme‚Äôs for longer than an hour to 24 hours max. lol that‚Äôs insane to me. I have ONE memecoin I held for too long, and that‚Äôs Chillguy. Had I sold when I should have, I could have made $90k or so on a $1000 investment. But there was so much narrative around that coin at the time, to hit $1 that I felt it was going to happen, 100%. I‚Äôm only down like $100 on it still, to this day.

So when it runs, they go tell all their friends ‚ÄúLook, that coin I told you about is running, don‚Äôt miss out!‚Äù People start to FOMO in at the Top, and they dump the supply on you.  I watched them do this with some famous coins that you now hear of regularly. You know SHIBA? Yea, they pumped the shit out of it in 2021-2022. They pumped it so hard that it actually did moon from all the FOMO, and became a Top 100 coin. No lie, I watched the whole thing happen, and even I 10x a Shiba bag during that run.

Memecoins factually have liquidity pools. NFTs do not. To sell an NFT you must find a buyer. Thats not the case with memecoins... because they have liquidity.   Memecoins factually have narrative, NFTs very rarely do.    The first memecoin was launched in 2013. Pumpfun did not invent memecoins. Trump did not invent memecoins. There has been a subculture devoted to them since the beginning of 2021.  They are not new.  They started on ETH and BSC, where they survived the bear market with an active culture, and they will continue to survive because they feed on a narrative of shared human experience.

For example, it is 3300x more energy-efficient than Ethereum.  But, to take Hedera to the next level, we need:   * **More aggressive marketing towards retail adoption**  * **Community nodes for increased decentralization**  Leemon Baird (inventor of Hedera) and Charles Hoskinson have been spending time together recently, proving there‚Äôs no need for hate or tribalism.

People haven't fully realized the risks of centralization, for example by more easily created barriers to access, needless governance and such, not having being devastated by centrally caused disasters yet quite enough, but tides will turn.   Kaspa is technologically on the right side. It's silver to BTC's gold, capable of scaling to massive amounts of transactions in a secure, non-centralized network.   If a similar technology were invented or copied, it would require a fair launch, something that Kaspa already had years ago.   It can be used as a base to launch any service requiring secure, decentralized, massive amount of transactions with a low cost, answering the question of ""what it's for"".

Unlike traditional blockchains, Hashgraph eliminates the need for mining or sequential block production. Instead, it leverages a gossip-about-gossip protocol combined with virtual voting, enabling transactions to be finalized in parallel with ultra-low latency.  While currently throttled at 10,000 TPS, Hedera‚Äôs unthrottled capacity ranges between 100,000 and 250,000 TPS. Its innovative algorithm also allows for infinite sharding, enabling 100,000+ TPS per shard without requiring Layer 2 solutions or network forks.  Hedera is inherently resistant to 51% attacks because there is no single blockchain to fork, no leader to overthrow, and no way to manipulate finality once consensus is reached. Its asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) security model is the highest level of security a decentralized system can achieve.",CryptoMarkets
