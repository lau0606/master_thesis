Solana has now the image of a scam chain, the chain of rugpulls. Ironically, the chain itself is a rugpull because considerable amounts of SOL will be released by the network for its venture capitalists in March, April and May.  2. Yearly inflation of 5-10% (Sol validators + usual VC unlocks). That's the worst creation rate in the world of smart contract blockchains.  3. Hyper centralisation of the validators (only 1000 validators, and history showed that most of them collude). Solana is an expensive database, not a secure blockchain.  4. Solana's real TPS is around 300. Any other number was faked by Solana's marketing team by adding protocol communications (that's the same as in the Ethereum ecosystem whose next upgrade in March will bring 600 TPS).

Ethereum is your best bet in that sense as it has the most dominance, but I personally would not DCA into any alts, and instead try to buy solid ones during bear markets as a gamble.  You won‚Äôt be mad in 4-8 years DCAing Bitcoin. Just stop looking at the price. Your goal is accumulation, the price up or down doesn‚Äôt matter.  Admittedly my approach when Bitcoin went down last cycle was to increase my DCA size when I could. Lower price, more in. This can also work well, but you need to have some cash for that (I just restricted lifestyle for a bit to increase my budget, or dipped into some savings).  Don‚Äôt go DCAing some random memecoin or alt that might not be here in 4 years. Consider alts a gamble, diversify when the time is right.",CryptoMarkets

These are currently less than 1% and no blockchain has ever had more than 10% of its rewards in the form of transaction fees. Even Peter Todd recognises this and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs a big proponent of tail emissions. The only other option is to support OP_CAT and embrace scaling and smart contracts to drive usage.  And it‚Äôs naive to think that institutions will mine at a loss, and also misses the point a little bit. Altruism is not a security mechanism. An argument can be made for institutions protecting their investment, however knowing the issues ahead of time will curtail them investment in the first place (we‚Äôre still only seeing 1% asset allocations, if that). But importantly it‚Äôs still pushing out individuals and smaller players I.e. centralizing hash power. You‚Äôre then essentially regressing to a consortium blockchain.

I don‚Äôt know if I got lucky or what, but I was playing with low amounts of money and selling fast as fuck. I‚Äôd dump $500 or so into a brand new coin and sell almost immediately on jumps. I‚Äôd never hold longer than an hour or so.   Some coins I‚Äôd make $20 on, some I‚Äôd make $2000 on.   I‚Äôd lose here and there, but overall I made quite a bit more than I lost.   Eventually I got out of meme‚Äôs towards the end of December, it just felt too intense and risky for me. But it feels more and more people got into meme‚Äôs soon after. And I feel now, that that market is over saturated.   Also, I don‚Äôt understand anyone who is holding meme‚Äôs for longer than an hour to 24 hours max. lol that‚Äôs insane to me. I have ONE memecoin I held for too long, and that‚Äôs Chillguy. Had I sold when I should have, I could have made $90k or so on a $1000 investment. But there was so much narrative around that coin at the time, to hit $1 that I felt it was going to happen, 100%. I‚Äôm only down like $100 on it still, to this day.

So when it runs, they go tell all their friends ‚ÄúLook, that coin I told you about is running, don‚Äôt miss out!‚Äù People start to FOMO in at the Top, and they dump the supply on you.  I watched them do this with some famous coins that you now hear of regularly. You know SHIBA? Yea, they pumped the shit out of it in 2021-2022. They pumped it so hard that it actually did moon from all the FOMO, and became a Top 100 coin. No lie, I watched the whole thing happen, and even I 10x a Shiba bag during that run.

Memecoins factually have liquidity pools. NFTs do not. To sell an NFT you must find a buyer. Thats not the case with memecoins... because they have liquidity.   Memecoins factually have narrative, NFTs very rarely do.    The first memecoin was launched in 2013. Pumpfun did not invent memecoins. Trump did not invent memecoins. There has been a subculture devoted to them since the beginning of 2021.  They are not new.  They started on ETH and BSC, where they survived the bear market with an active culture, and they will continue to survive because they feed on a narrative of shared human experience.

But, to take Hedera to the next level, we need:   * **More aggressive marketing towards retail adoption**  * **Community nodes for increased decentralization**  Leemon Baird (inventor of Hedera) and Charles Hoskinson have been spending time together recently, proving there‚Äôs no need for hate or tribalism.

People haven't fully realized the risks of centralization, for example by more easily created barriers to access, needless governance and such, not having being devastated by centrally caused disasters yet quite enough, but tides will turn.   Kaspa is technologically on the right side. It's silver to BTC's gold, capable of scaling to massive amounts of transactions in a secure, non-centralized network.   If a similar technology were invented or copied, it would require a fair launch, something that Kaspa already had years ago.

Unlike traditional blockchains, Hashgraph eliminates the need for mining or sequential block production. Instead, it leverages a gossip-about-gossip protocol combined with virtual voting, enabling transactions to be finalized in parallel with ultra-low latency.  While currently throttled at 10,000 TPS, Hedera‚Äôs unthrottled capacity ranges between 100,000 and 250,000 TPS. Its innovative algorithm also allows for infinite sharding, enabling 100,000+ TPS per shard without requiring Layer 2 solutions or network forks.

The over regulation of utility coins, which also had thousands of failed projects and scams to be honest, but at least tried to provide a use case even when they were lying to you or the use case was already covered better by a competitor or was of such limited actual utility it failed, kind of led to memecoins.   Memecoins are purely speculative assets based on sweet fuck all, but because they make that clear ""invest at your own risk"" are outside of the regs others have to meet, made it a massive market essentially for gambling. Yeah, yeah, you got rich. Skill issue - ""I got in on sniper bots early,"" blah blah, means some people make bank trading still. The vast majority don't.   Most of the money is made by those rug pulling or putting out coins where the tokenomics are so skewed in favour of whoever developed them (the word developed is used very loosely here) that you've got better odds on return on a scratch card.    There was a bubble created, and for a brief window, most people investing in them had the chance to make gains then. It's popped now or extremely close to popping.   Solana was the easiest to launch memecoins on, so the two are now linked to the extent that when the memecoin bubble bursts, it takes Solana's price down with it. It's also damaged Solana's reputation at the same time.   From my less than expert perspective that, but I don't think you need to be an expert in crypto to see it. It's pretty obvious. The same way you don't have to be an economic expert to look back at history and realise that Tulip Mania was also a bubble based on very little inherent value.",solana

Memes arent dead either the good projects that formed solid communities of holders who wont sell like GIGA, Popcat, WIF and BONK will come back around and those who are buying these dips are going to make a ton of money.

You also seem to give Trump somewhat of a free pass for doing the exact same thing. Anyone with 1/2 a braincell knows that it's a vehicle for people to funnel money to him. He has several of those now (e.g., his media company, his hotels and golf courses etc.). Any individual actor or foreign government can now easily find a way to bribe Trump.

Oh, and my instincts told me so not too long ago that this was the end. I think we're getting close. Like a big dip. Like a 30% BTC dip. Then another 30% BTC dip. Then another one. BTC goes to sub 50K in this bear market. It went down to 16K roughly on the last trough. I'd say we'll see about  double to double and a half of that. So, anywhere from 32K to 48K, ETFs won't make any real difference this time or next time. Reason is because it was the ETFs that front ran the fucking car, and when things go badly south and they WILL, the EFT will be like the car where the bottom flew out from beneath it for several miles, leaving just the caboose and those who didn't get out of that car when they had the opportunity are gonna be fucken sore and sorry.  People think I'm an idiot. But I have seen lots of bad things happen to people who never lended an ear to their instincts. Never lended a brain to them. If you head is telling you something, you listen. If your gut tells you something, you listen. If you need to take a dump you gonna feel something, right? That's your gut saying ""I need to go"". So, going to the restroom and doing a #2 is like hitting that sell button. Sometimes you just gotta dump it because its gonna become toxic.  This is more relevant to alts than to BTC. MUCH more relevant. You got 'em? Dump 'em once you get to the next restroom. There will be another one down the road.

Initially promoted by President Javier Milei, the token's value soared to a $4.5 billion market cap before crashing. Davis confirmed holding $100 million in missing funds but is unsure of their future. Allegations of insider trading and market manipulation surfaced, with sniper bots and insiders profiting before retail investors. Milei distanced himself from the project amid political pressure, leading to calls for his impeachment and legal investigations.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

As soon as the token is created and bonding curve created  bots would buy a token  with anything between $20-$500.  Lets call that one bot 1   Then seconds if not milliseconds later another bot does the same with a similar amount. Lets call this one bot2.  Bot1 detects a buy transaction from bot2 and immediately dumps . With profit of 1% if not less.  Bot2 realises he f-ed up and dumps with 1% loss   Or when the token doesn't have locked liquidity and just empties the liquidity pool as soon as someone buys  Small profit but  Rinse repeat 10, 000 times...   99% of meme tokens  are out of liquidity in a matter of minutes. Other 1% last longer but mainly because more effort is put in them in terms of marketing or release strategy. And that's  where we have these ""celebrity"" endorsements.   0.01 reach some kind of upward  trend that lasts for a few days   But they all end up rugged pulled at some point    I think the majority know that these meme coins will get rug pulled... but are betting on the idea that they will be out first before or snipe some profits.  While people  drop lifesavings into these shitty coins,  I think in a small minority.  The beauty of blockchain you can track transactions. And you can see that a wallet that dropped 50k in some shitty coin is actually  part of trading bot   (aka volume boosters) that trade between themselves in order to boost transaction and volume and appear as legitimate token.  Anyway point being:   the meme coin market at this stage is  scammers and rug pullers trying to outsmart each other with very  few trying to scam naive investors",CryptoCurrency

A: regulation and enforcement of the rules, transparency and every group must stay on their ground: the judges/court, those with money & knowledge, those with an opportunity & knowledge looking for money, the stock market organiser, the law-makers, the research community researching ""economy/trading"", etc.   Example: Transparency: if it's decided that 10 million shares/coins will be released in total, you cannot  1. pass on 1 million coins to friends for free before they are being released ""officially"". 2. you cannot create 1 million additional coins in a year or so ""when nobody is looking, doing it slowly in packages of 100"".  Q&A: How is the price usually determined during an initial public offer of shares?   A: ""Building the book"" = the job of the investment bank = they go around potentially interested investors in your particular product/service - people who know your market, have investments in it, can estimate the value/risk/opportunity with their knowledge.

""memecoins"" (shitcoins) are a symptom of poverty and desperation.  If you have $10000 to invest (actual money, not a loan or money you can't afford to lose) you'll throw it into BTC and it will probably double in value in a year or 2 (maybe faster given how bad inflation will be).   The people throwing money at shitcoins (aka gambling) have almost nothing, maybe even less than nothing if they are in debt. Say you only have $100 to ""invest"", of course you're going to gamble it looking for the next ""100x"" because a lottery win is the only thing that will change your fortune.   I'm not defending these gamblers, they are idiots and they should not be touching crypto at all, but I can see why they make such stupid decisions. What's the point of buying $100 of BTC when you are poor? Yes it will probably be worth $200 in a year but that's not going to change how poor you are or how much debt you are in.",CryptoCurrency

(As an aside, this is an interesting feature of futures--to close a ""short"" you have to actually *buy* a long, sounds kinda counterintuitive).  again, key difference here is that you do *not* need to borrow anything.  you are obligated to *deliver* the asset at the contracts expiration--so, hopefully it's at a lower price than when you opened your short",CryptoCurrency
