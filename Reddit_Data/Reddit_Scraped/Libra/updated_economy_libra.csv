"Meme coin destroys Argentina’s economy - president Milei faces impeachment. There’s a lesson in this, Mr. Trump . . .",https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1it4o9e/meme_coin_destroys_argentinas_economy_president/,2025-02-19 12:47:36,7,2025-02-19 14:49:11,16,"This is one of your less deranged rants... But you still miss the point IMO.   You basically say that Millei's pump and dump is bad because it might lead to a return to socialism.. rather than focusing plainly on the fact that scamming your constituents out of billions in and of itself is bad.   You also seem to give Trump somewhat of a free pass for doing the exact same thing. Anyone with 1/2 a braincell knows that it's a vehicle for people to funnel money to him. He has several of those now (e.g., his media company, his hotels and golf courses etc.). Any individual actor or foreign government can now easily find a way to bribe Trump. That's hugely concerning.   .. and not to mention the pump and dump on his constituents.",economy

You leave out a ton of pertinent details, such as how the original post appeared to be a mistake, and that the president himself referred this to the government to be investigated.  That looks like transparency to me.  ""Figures close to Milei rejected the possibility of an impeachment, with Congressman Diego Santilli calling such calls an attempt to “overthrow” the president.  Security Minister Patricia Bullrich defended Milei, telling Radio Rivadavia: “The president has the freedom of expression to raise the issues he wants.” She also compared his message on X with a presidential visit to a factory, saying that “it does not imply that he is creating a lobby for that place.”""     did you even read your own article?       This is pure rage bait.  If the 6 people who still follow CNN could read they would be very upset.",economy
