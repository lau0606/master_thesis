The over regulation of utility coins, which also had thousands of failed projects and scams to be honest, but at least tried to provide a use case even when they were lying to you or the use case was already covered better by a competitor or was of such limited actual utility it failed, kind of led to memecoins.   Memecoins are purely speculative assets based on sweet fuck all, but because they make that clear ""invest at your own risk"" are outside of the regs others have to meet, made it a massive market essentially for gambling. Yeah, yeah, you got rich. Skill issue - ""I got in on sniper bots early,"" blah blah, means some people make bank trading still. The vast majority don't.   Most of the money is made by those rug pulling or putting out coins where the tokenomics are so skewed in favour of whoever developed them (the word developed is used very loosely here) that you've got better odds on return on a scratch card.    There was a bubble created, and for a brief window, most people investing in them had the chance to make gains then. It's popped now or extremely close to popping.   Solana was the easiest to launch memecoins on, so the two are now linked to the extent that when the memecoin bubble bursts, it takes Solana's price down with it. It's also damaged Solana's reputation at the same time.   From my less than expert perspective that, but I don't think you need to be an expert in crypto to see it. It's pretty obvious. The same way you don't have to be an economic expert to look back at history and realise that Tulip Mania was also a bubble based on very little inherent value.",solana

The reason memes didnt run as hard on ETH or other platforms is because Solana did it cheaper, better and faster.   Memes arent dead either the good projects that formed solid communities of holders who wont sell like GIGA, Popcat, WIF and BONK will come back around and those who are buying these dips are going to make a ton of money.   This dip is signaling the death of KOLs inside trading and dumping normies, quality meme projects on Solana will survive and flourish and the people coming back will see that buy back in.   Overall in the grand scheme of things Solana did what no other crypto has done and proved that can actually have real world applications, like imagine if supermarkets, gas stations, online commerce used Solana as payment.

It's funny how other chains are fudding solana for being centralized (which is false) while simultaneously complaining about it not having enough oversight, then complaining about it only being good for meme-gambling yet taking the first opportunity to have their own creators shill memecoins on their chain (charles for example) the very second they see some bad sentiment at Solana.
